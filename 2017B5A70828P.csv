Dear Student,

Hope you are busy with your Test 1 preparations.
Please note the tentative test and ppt schedule for Day 1 of the Internship Season 2020-21 to keep you informed in advance.
Day 1 Test Schedule
20th Sept, Sun
21st Sept, Mon
Day 1 Interviews on Sept 22-24 
HUL Interviews on Sept 21

    CGPA Cutoff for Day 1 companies will be 7.0 (might be higher for some companies)

Goldman Sachs and JPMC will be hosted on Day 1 with a total of 6-8 companies.
Remaining companies will be disclosed as they will be opened for applications between Sept 16-19.


    Applications for all Day 1 companies will be opened via Superset or Google Forms during Sept 16-19 for a window of 16-18 hours. Please make a note to apply during that window only and not to bother with requests afterwards.
    Reiterating, the first offer you get is your last offer in the Internship Season 2020-21.

    Ensuring technical support (electricity backup, network) is students' responsibility and the PU doesn't take any accountability for the lack of same at your end. No requests for issues at your end will be entertained.

    Please refrain from any malpractices during the online assessments as it takes a lot of efforts to bring companies, especially in these times and any single act of misconduct could render those efforts of the PU futile.

    All the best for the Internship Season and stay active on your mails and the slack channel for regular updates.

Placement Unit

Hi Varkeychan Jacob,

You have been invited to take Intuit India - on campus Sep 26 2020 by Intuit India.

Test details


Important

    Once the test starts, you cannot pause it. The test will run continuously for 1 hrs 30 mins.

Before you begin

Before you take the Intuit India - on campus Sep 26 2020, we recommend that you take the practice test a few days before the actual test.

Advantages of taking the practice test

    You get familiar with the HackerEarth Recruit platform including the proctoring settings. The actual test may have fewer restrictions than the practice test. This advanced familiarity will enable you to solve problems more efficiently during the actual test.
    An automatic system-compatibility check is performed before you start the test. If your system isn't compatible, you must make the required changes before you take the actual test.

Regards,

Team Intuit India

Dear student,

Hope you are doing well and staying safe.

We have observed that a very low number of students are practicing the Aptitude tests (Program-A). Given that placements for semester-1 is right around the corner, and a majority of companies across all domains have aptitude tests as initial screening, we as the Placement Unit strongly advise you to not underestimate the value of these tests. Major filtering of students from the company's end happens in the Aptitude test, making it essential for a student to take it seriously. Historically, we have observed that students who start early and practice regularly have always qualified the initial screening tests easily. The quality of these tests are at par with the actual company tests, also sometimes certain questions are found common between the two. 

We strongly advise you to start preparing by practicing these tests, as onccemente the Placement Season begins, students are found lacking time for preparation. There are company specific coding + aptitude tests included in the subscription, apart from the whole Aptitude preparation module making it beneficial to all the students.

We wish you all the best for the Placement Season ahead.

Please contact us if you face any issues regarding the tests or the platform.

Regards,
Placement Unit.

At the end of the test, there is a feedback survey that is required to be completed. Browser usage is logged, so please do not access any sites that require login or are private repositories.

During the reasoning section, you will not be able to skip and return to questions.

The time remaining will be clearly displayed on the screen. You will not be able to stop the timer once you have started each test.

We are pleased to inform you that JSW has tied hands with World Steel Association on their steelChallenge-16 competition. This yearly competition is recognised by the global steel community as the preeminent competition to engage students and industry professionals to showcase their ability to make the best quality steel at lowest cost.  This is a brilliant opportunity to find and nurture talent for the steel industry and needless to say is a great opportunity for the participants to learn and grow.

The World Steel Association opened registration for the 16th edition of steelChallenge. steelChallenge is the biggest steel industry competition where students and industry employees can test their skills using the sophisticated online process simulations delivered by steeluniversity. 

New this year, there will be carbon footprint requirements for the steel grade to reinforce the steel industry commitment to reduce the footprint from its operations.

 

steelChallenge-16 will take place over two rounds. The Regional Championship will take place online on 24 November 2021 from 5.30 PM. Participants will use a combination of the Electric Arc Furnace and the Secondary Steelmaking simulators, producing the required steel at the lowest cost.  They will be asked to produce steel and refine it to the proper chemistry and temperature.


    Americas,
    Asia – East and Oceania,
    Asia – North,
    Asia – West, and
    Europe and Africa.

 

The World Championship will be in April 2022.

All participants successfully completing a simulation run will get an official completion certificate by steeluniversity. In addition, when registering for the competition, participants will get a full pack of learning resources including e-learning courses, 3D interactive models and practice simulations.

The Regional Champions will receive a cash prize, a regional championship certificate and the invitation to the World Championship. They will also gain recognition as the global industry’s promising new generation of metallurgists and will be featured on the steeluniversity website. 

The World Champions will get the steelChallenge trophy and receive an additional cash prize and a certificate.

__

 

JSW will also give out certificates, merchandise and goodies for each student who registered and appeared for the challenge! Hurry Up!

Trump's Syria withdrawal plan shocks allies
US president says Islamic State has been defeated, but defence officials want to maintain a US military presence in the region
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria will be welcomed by Russia and Iran, both of whom have been working hard to supplant American influence in the region.

The biggest losers from the move meanwhile are likely to be US allies, such as the Kurds and Israel – not to mention the US itself, which could end up being drawn back into the region if, as some expect, the withdrawal helps Islamic State forces regroup.

shock decision
Is the US withdrawal from Syria premature?
To the surprise of his allies and the frustration of senior officials Donald Trump has decided to pull out all US troops from Syria, claiming Islamic State had been “defeated” and their job is done.

There are currently around 2,000 US troops on the ground in the war-torn country where they are primarily training local forces to combat Islamic State (IS). They have helped rid much of north-eastern Syria of the terrorist group, but pockets of fighters remain.

Nevertheless, “a complete, rapid withdrawal, if confirmed, would upend assumptions about a longer-term US military presence in Syria” reports Al Jazeera. READ MORE ▸

US economy
Fed raises rates despite pressure from Trump
The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates again, following a two-day meeting to discuss the state of the US economy.

The move, which adds 0.25% to official interest rates aiming to reach a target between 2.25% and 2.5%, came despite unprecedented public lobbying by Donald Trump, who had pre-emptively called a rate rise “foolish” and “crazy”.

Strategies for Debriefing Healthcare Scenarios


Presented by Center for Advanced Pediatric and Perinatal Education (CAPE), a part of Stanford Medicine

Healthcare professionals work in complex, high-risk environments where safety is paramount. Yet, they often don’t have the necessary time and tools to analyze their performance during training in order to develop strategies to overcome weaknesses and reinforce strengths. Debriefing is one of the most effective methods for empowering healthcare professionals of all experience levels to improve their individual and team performance. By fostering a nonjudgmental and productive environment you can help your team hone their ability to provide consistent, high-quality, safe patient care.

In this webinar, CAPE’s directors, Lou Halamek, M.D. and Nicole Yamada, M.D., will use an interactive discussion and video exemplars from CAPE’s new online debriefing program to highlight and analyze four foundational strategies from CAPE’s 20 Strategies for Effective Debriefing.


    How to clearly communicate expectations for how a debriefing will be conducted

    How to begin debriefings in an objective and efficient manner

    Ways to avoid creating defensiveness during debriefings

What a Tory-Farage pact would mean
Brexit Party leader is willing to ‘do a deal with the devil to get a proper Brexit’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

“I would do a deal with the devil to get a proper Brexit,” Nigel Farage said recently on his LBC radio show. But the MEP may not have to call on Lucifer to get his wish.

With the Conservatives reportedly plotting an electoral tie-up, this afternoon’s top story looks at how a Tory-Brexit Party pact might work.

'secret talks'
What a Tory-Farage pact would mean
Nigel Farage is in “secret talks” with Tory party donors about a pact for a snap general election, it has been reported.

The Daily Telegraph claims the Conservatives might offer not to stand candidates against Farage’s Brexit Party in dozens of seats, in a bid to ensure the UK leaves the European Union by the end of October.

“Under the idea, the Brexit Party could agree not to stand against Tory Brexiteer candidates, while the Tories would not fight Metropolitan Labour seats in the north of England where the Brexit Party is strong,” reports the Telegraph.

A woman jailed for killing a schoolgirl as a teenager was able to teach at primary school in Oxford for almost a year without disclosing her conviction, it has emerged.

Iria Suarez-Gonzalez, now 35, became “one of Spain’s most notorious killers” after she and a friend stabbed 16-year-old Clara Garcia to death in 2000, the Oxford Mail reports. According to media reports from the time, the pair - who cut Garcia’s throat and stabbed her 32 times - were driven by a desire to know “what it would feel like to kill someone”.

DOWN TO BUSINESS
Monday afternoon markets
London’s leading share index inched higher today in line with marginal gains across Europe, “as rises in banks outweighed the impact of a profit alert from Germany's Lufthansa on airlines, while UK contractor Kier Group skidded to a life low”, reports Reuters.

Shares in easyJet and British Airways owner IAG took a hit after the German airline giant issued a shock profit warning, admitting that its short-haul business had been dented by fierce competition and amid concerns over surging fuel costs.

Shares in the US benefited from slight gains as markets opened this morning, while the big mover was Sotheby’s, whose shares were up 58%, after French businessman, Patrick Drahi, agreed to buy the auction house for $3.7bn.


VIEWPOINT
Quote of the day
“There is a growing feeling in the party that when we get to the final two we should have a robust debate between two credible change candidates. We need change… People don’t want to see a final that’s some kind of Oxford Union debate.”
Tory leadership hopeful Sajid Javid says the final run-off should not be between two old Etonians and Oxford graduates.

What does prorogation mean for your money?
	  	
  	There are many questions being asked by investors today as a result of yesterday's decision to prorogue parliament.

    Will this trigger a vote of no confidence?
    Will the pound fall again?
    Will people ""sell"" and do their research later?

MoneyWeek's executive editor, John Stepek says “I'd expect turbulence over the next couple of months, certainly. But if you're an active investor and stock picker, I'd use that time to build up your cash reserves and make a watchlist of stocks that you want to buy. This is the kind of torrid atmosphere that creates buying opportunities for quality companies at usually low valuations.""

Subscribe to MoneyWeek for exclusive access to our weekly share tips feature to help build your watchlist. It will only cost you £12 for 3 months and is the fastest way to enjoy a complete view of the markets and what Brexit means for your money.

On June 18, 2019, Facebook announced its plan to launch a more stable and useful “next generation” cryptocurrency in 2020, called “Libra.” Does this new “global digital currency” mark the beginning of a new phase in the evolution of cryptocurrency, or will it fall flat? 

Join Stanford Professor and former SEC Commissioner Joe Grundfest, one of the world’s leading experts in cryptocurrency and related regulatory matters, in a conversation about Libra and the future of cryptocurrency.


    What Libra is and the potential effect it has on the global economy

    Why Libra is a threat to banks and credit card companies

    What key challenges Facebook must overcome in order to achieve success

    Why regulators are skeptical of this new plan

Dear Watchers,

Thank you to all who wrote in to share their social-distancing viewing rituals and projects. It sounds as if a lot of folks are finally summiting Mt. “Sopranos,” and I wish all of them a blessed voyage.

I hope those of you who can stay home are staying home, and I hope those of you who are working in essential services are getting the support you need.

Stay safe, be cool, and I’ll see you Wednesday.

I Want Something Engrossing



This five-part documentary is among the best nonfiction series ever made. It blew me away when it premiered in 2016, and I have thought about it hundreds of times since, both its literal accomplishments in format and its broader ideas and themes. It’s about O.J. Simpson, but it’s also about everything — race and sports, of course, but also California history, models of justice and the light-bending heft of fame and power.

I Want Something Emotional

‘Enlightened’


Social distancing can make one a little numbed, so reconnect to the human endeavor with this beautiful two-season HBO dramedy about the tricky parts and some of the good parts of being alive. Laura Dern stars as Amy Jellicoe, who thinks maybe she can change the world, starting with her corrupt company, or maybe herself, or her mom, or her ex-husband. The show’s prickliness can take some getting used to, so I encourage you to give the show four episodes to get its vibe. It has some of the emotional ideas of a fairy tale — the sense of longing, the bold individualism, the urgency — but the grounding and brininess of a social satire. If you’ve been reading more poems lately and feel you need to take your heart for a walk, watch this.

I Am Going Stir Crazy
Now we can all study the blade.Annette Brown/History



Sometimes all that’s left is watching people stab buckets of sand with homemade swords. God bless. This obstacle-course series is like a hot tub for your brain — I wouldn’t do it 24/7, but there are times you just need to be blissed out and boiled stupid. Competitors bring their own blades of choice and put them to the test with a series of strange challenges, like slicing through a raw chicken hanging from a string, or cutting through a watermelon dropped from the ceiling. There’s no blood and guts, and the show emphasizes safety and sportsmanship, so it’s also fine for most ages. I have seen every episode.

With theater chains shuttering multiplexes to prevent the spread of coronavirus, major studios have scrambled to make new theatrical releases available for home viewing. Since our last Monday newsletter, several major studio films were released online early, and this week’s newly available titles include a few more early arrivals — along with the year’s biggest flop and the story of a violin prodigy who vanished during World War II.

Unless noted, the films can be purchased on the usual platforms — Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. A rental option is usually available within a few weeks, though some are available for short-term rental now. (Click here for more details.)


‘Emma’ (available now)
Everything has been emphatically embellished, so much so that it initially seems that [the director Autumn de Wilde] has adapted the material using Wes Anderson software. — Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‘The Hunt’ (now)
An almost-successful attempt to do for class and ideology what Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” did for racism. — A.O. Scott (Read the full review here.)

‘The Invisible Man’ (now — A Critic’s Pick)
This shrewd, cleverly updated version plays with the different meanings of “romance” by fusing the basic conceit from [H.G. Wells’s] uncanny tale with the fallout of an abusive romantic relationship. — Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‘Onward’ (now; on Disney Plus April 3)
The mild, one-joke amusement of ‘Onward,’ directed by Dan Scanlon (“Monsters University”), comes from the clash of the mundane and the fantastical. — Ben Kenigsberg (Read the full review here.)

‘Birds of Prey’ (coming Tuesday)
Unlike “Joker,” this exercise in R-rated fan-flattery allows itself, and the audience, to have some fun with its noisy, hectic, self-conscious riffing on the conventions of comic-book-based entertainment. — A.O. Scott (Read the full review here.)

‘Bloodshot’ (Tuesday)
“Bloodshot” runs out of meta tricks before it is over, and David S.F. Wilson, who borrows his visual vocabulary from Tony Scott and Michael Bay, delivers action sequences with such choppy continuity that viewers may be as confused as [its hero]. — Ben Kenigsberg (Read the full review here.)

‘Dolittle’ (Tuesday)
[The director Stephen Gaghan] apparently ran into issues while making “Dolittle,” leading the studio to bring in other filmmakers. Even so, the story remains thin, the performances wobbly, the laughs infrequent. — Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‘The Gentleman’ (Tuesday)
The point is cleverness and looking cool … mostly the movie is about [Guy Ritchie’s] own conspicuous pleasure directing famous actors having a lark, trading insults, making mischief. — Manohla Dargis (Read the full review here.)

‘Just Mercy’ (Tuesday)
Just Mercy is saved from being an earnest, inert courtroom drama when it spends time on death row, where it is opened up and given depth by two strong, subtle performances, from Jamie Foxx and Rob Morgan. — A.O. Scott (Read the full review here.)

‘The Song of Names’ (Tuesday)
The movie never quite justifies the contrivance of its puzzle-box construction. Parlaying this material into an arty whodunit cheapens the real history invoked. — Ben Kenigsberg (Read the full review here.)

Essie Davis in “Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears.”Acorn TV

    The movie sequel to the Australian series “Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries,” “Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears,” is now streaming on Acorn. It has a sort of diet “Indiana Jones” vibe and can be a little on the hokey side, but the show’s charm and glam are back in full force, too. Become a hat person! Embrace your truth!

Wait, one more thing …

If you are considering adding a streaming service to your current lineup, note that a lot of them are offering promotional extended free trials right now. Slate has a roundup of most of them, and Amazon, Hulu and Netflix also have free 30-day trials (as usual). If you’re looking for classic, foreign and art-house films, Criterion Channel is offering a 14-day trial and Mubi is now charging $1 for three months’ access.

Statistical errors are surprisingly common in medical literature. Fortunately, you don’t need a degree in statistics to catch these errors. In many cases nothing more than common sense and simple arithmetic is required. In addition, there is an ever-increasing number of free, easy-to-use online statistical tools that facilitate error detection. In this session, Stanford Associate Professor Kristin Sainani demonstrates how to apply these statistical sleuthing tools using real-world examples.

Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (XCS224N)

Natural language processing (NLP) is undergoing rapid evolution as new methods and toolsets converge with an ever-expanding availability of data. Our upcoming course, Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, provides a thorough introduction to the modern neural network algorithms for the processing of linguistic information.

""I have taken several online courses in AI, and most of them helped me learn something new. But, XCS224N goes right at the top of my list. It is one of the best advanced courses I have taken as it strikes a good balance between theory and practice, beginner and advanced concepts. It makes you work a lot harder than other courses, but the end result is worth it."" --Ashish K.

This cohort-based 10-week course begins June 8, 2020.

Today we’re launching the Unsplash Book Club 📚

Unsplash Book Club 

‪One of the biggest challenges of launching a new book is promotion.‬

‪It’s doubly hard in today’s environment with no book tours or conferences.

We wanted to do something about this while sharing interesting, new books with you.

So today, we’re launching Unsplash Book Club ‪— a featured collection of books coming soon.‬

Each book we partner with, will be giving free-use access to never-before-seen visuals from their book. Sometimes it will be a first look at the cover. Sometimes it will be excerpts or visuals from the book.
See the Unsplash Book Club
	
	
How Innovation Works with Matt Ridley

Our first featured book is How Innovation Works by the incomparable Matt Ridley. Matt is is the award-winning, bestselling author of several books, including The Rational Optimist and The Evolution of Everything. His books have sold more than one million copies in thirty languages worldwide.


What excites us about Matt’s book is learning more about what underlying conditions lead to innovation. Matt’s book is full of examples from steam engines to search engines and even life itself. We’re excited to learn about these examples and think about what we may be able to apply to Unsplash and in life.


How Innovation Works hits North American shelves today and the UK, June 25.‬ You can buy or pre-order a copy on Amazon.


If you’d like to join the Unsplash Book Club, enter your email here. We’ll be launching new books every so often and you’ll get an update as soon as we do.

‘Air bridges’ raise hopes of holidays abroad
Quarantine rules may be relaxed between some countries
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

If the warm weather has whetted your appetite for a summer holiday, this afternoon’s newsletter contains mixed news. 

On the one hand, travellers bound for a select few destinations may benefit from an intriguing - if vague - “air bridge” arrangement... but everyone else will be stuck in quarantine.

‘Air bridges’ give Brits hope of holidays abroad
Would-be holidaymakers’ hopes of trips abroad this year have been boosted by proposals to exempt Britons who travel to countries with low coronavirus infection rates from strict new quarantine rules. 

The plan to form so-called “air bridges” between the UK and lower-risk countries was floated by senior Tory MP Huw Merriman and has won the backing of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. 

The proposal comes a week after Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that it was “unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer”, as a result of a “blanket” 14-day quarantine for arrivals to the UK that is due to be introduced from next month.

Why did UK take so long to introduce quarantine?
The UK is set to join the growing number of countries that have introduced quarantine rules for people arriving from abroad - but critics are asking why Boris Johnson’s government waited so long. 

Brussels-based news site EUobserver reported in March that nine European Union states had closed their borders entirely, and Germany - which has been lauded for its coronavirus response - has had quarantine measures in place since early April.

And the UK isn’t alone in its weight wars during the global pandemic. According to The Telegraph, Italians emerged from two months of lockdown an average 2kg (4.4lbs) heavier.

“There is a reason why Jacob Rees-Mogg’s passionate defence of in-person parliamentary democracy went viral last week. ‘Simply a series of prepared statements made one after another. That’s not the House of Commons doing its proper duty its proper role of scrutiny of the Government.’ The proper democratic system of this country has been fundamentally diluted.”

WHO says pandemic is ‘getting worse’
The spread of Covid-19 is accelerating around the world
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The coronavirus news is decidedly mixed this morning, with caution optimism in the UK set against a gloomier picture worldwide.

Testing data show declining infection rates in most parts of the UK, even as lockdown restrictions are lifted, but the global pandemic is yet to reach its peak.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. WHO says coronavirus pandemic is ‘getting worse’
The spread of Covid-19 is accelerating globally, with infections doubling in the past six weeks, the head of the World Health Organization has warned. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the pandemic has yet to reach its peak. “In most of the world, the virus is not under control,” he said. “It is getting worse … more than 544,000 lives have been lost. The pandemic is still accelerating.”

2. Court rules that prosecutors can see Trump tax returns
The US Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump’s financial records can be examined by prosecutors. However, the court said they did not have to be shared with Congress. The ruling has “cemented the fact that the public isn't going to get a look at his tax returns before the November election”, says CNN. His predecessors have made their financial records public voluntarily. 

3. ‘Work out to help out’ as gyms set to re-open
Gyms, pools, nail bars and tattooists will be allowed to re-open from 25 July as the government lifts restrictions on leisure facilities and beauty services in England. Team sports - starting with cricket – will also be permitted to resume. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged people to “work out to help out”. Two reports charting coronavirus cases in England show the number of people with the disease is falling.

4. Government ‘will borrow half a trillion’ as Covid costs mount
The government is on course to borrow half a trillion pounds over two years as the cost of its response to the coronavirus pandemic mounts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that this year’s deficit will reach £350bn - a record for any peacetime year. The Daily Telegraph says the “debt mountain” will “pose a challenge to Rishi Sunak and his successors as chancellor for many decades to come”.

5. US announces China sanctions over Muslim camps
Washington has announced sanctions against China for its human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Beijing is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others. Rights groups say up to a million Muslims have been detained in high-security prison camps across Xinjiang province. However, the authorities deny any mistreatment of Muslims.

6. Boots and John Lewis cut 5,300 jobs as retail wobbles
Dozens of stores will close and more than 5,300 people will lose their jobs as the coronavirus pandemic takes another chunk out of retail. Boots is cutting 4,000 jobs – or 7% of its workforce – by closing 48 opticians outlets and reducing staff at its head office in Nottingham. John Lewis says it plans to permanently shut eight of its 50 stores, including branches in Birmingham and Watford.

7. BBC suggests staff include gender pronouns in their emails
The BBC is encouraging staff to include their preferred pronouns in email signatures, to make transgender and non-binary colleagues feel more welcome. New guidance, posted on the corporation’s intranet, says adding pronouns at the foot of emails - for example, he, she or they - is a “small, proactive step that we can all take to help create a more inclusive workplace”.

8. Boris Johnson to roll out anti-obesity initiative
The prime minister is poised to launch an anti-obesity drive, starting with a ban on supermarket promotions of unhealthy food. Stores will be prevented from offering buy one, get one free deals on targeted products. However, campaigners are disappointed that Boris Johnoson is likely to delay the introduction of a 9pm watershed on the advertising of unhealthy food.

9. Top charities say lockdown is harming dementia patients
Charities say that families of care home residents with dementia should be treated as key workers. They have written to the government to argue that visits and care from family members are “essential” to residents’ mental and physical health and that lockdown restrictions have had “damaging consequences”. The letter is signed by the leaders of charities including Dementia UK and the Alzheimer’s Society. 

10. China warns of virus deadlier than Covid-19 in Kazakhstan
Chinese officials have warned that an “unknown pneumonia” with an alarming mortality rate has broken out in Kazakhstan. “The death rate of this disease is much higher than the novel coronavirus,” the Chinese embassy wrote in a warning to Chinese citizens in Kazakhstan. The local health ministry says it has recorded more than 32,000 cases of pneumonia between June 29 and July 5 alone, along with 451 deaths.

‘You'd better shape up’
Reporting on the reopening of gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres, Metro tells readers “You’d better shape up.” The Times says that it is time for the nation to “work out to help out”.

The Mirror prefers to focus on the “Jobs hell at high street icons” after cuts at Boots, Burger King and John Lewis. The Financial Times leads on the same story, reporting that Rishi Sunak is “under fire” for his “poorly targeted” support.

“They’ve sunk our cruises,” complains the Daily Mail, splashing the news that the Foreign Office has warned against travel on cruise ships. It says the “dramatic intervention” is a “huge blow” to the travel industry.

Spain insists it is safe after UK launches new quarantine
Country’s largest coronavirus outbreaks are under control, say Spanish authorities
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Among those caught out by the UK’s sudden “handbrake restriction” on arrivals from Spain was Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who had just begun a holiday in the country at the weekend.  

Like everyone else, Shapps will now be required to self-isolate for 14 days on his return.

The cabinet minister may be feeling confident he will still have his job at the end of it. Others, with less flexible employers, have expressed fears that they may not be so lucky.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Spain insists it is safe after UK launches new quarantine
Spain says it is safe to visit despite outbreaks of new coronavirus cases. “Spain is safe for Spaniards and for tourists,” said the foreign minister after the UK abruptly ordered people coming from the country to quarantine. The UK’s move to require arrivals from Spain to self-isolate for 14 days came into effect on Sunday.

2. Over-40s may pay more tax to tackle social care crisis
People over 40 would start contributing towards the cost of care in later life under plans being considered by ministers to end the crisis in social care. Over-40s would have to pay more in tax or national insurance, or be compelled to insure themselves against “hefty bills” for care when they are older, says The Guardian. Last year, Boris Johnson vowed to “fix the crisis in social care once and for all”.

3. Speaker fears No. 10 briefings will sideline Commons
Parliament could be sidelined by plans for daily televised press briefings from Downing Street, the Commons Speaker has warned. Sir Lindsay Hoyle told the BBC he was worried the proposal was “not the way forward” and insisted that major announcements should always be made in Parliament first. No. 10 is planning to trial daily televised press briefings from October, modelled on briefings from the White House.

4. Anti-obesity drive to include ban on in-store promotions
Buy-one-get-one-free deals on unhealthy food will be banned as part of the government’s drive to tackle obesity. There will also be restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in store and new guidelines for displaying calories on menus. Boris Johnson said the plans would help “reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus”.

5. Portland demonstrators bring down courthouse fence
Protesters in Portland have brought down a steel fence around a courthouse after days of trying. Federal agents fired teargas and “non-lethal projectiles” to drive back thousands of demonstrators surrounding the courthouse to demand Donald Trump withdraw the paramilitaries. The Guardian says Portland is the focal point of nationwide protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

6. Regulator to get tough on airlines over holiday refunds
Regulators are poised to launch a crackdown on airlines that have failed to refund families for flights cancelled due to coronavirus. The Daily Telegraph says the Civil Aviation Authority is understood to have drawn up a list of the “worst culprits”, with millions of customers still owed billions of pounds after being told they could not fly. The body may threaten carriers with a ban from operating in the UK.

7. Republican senator says slavery was ‘necessary evil’
A Republican senator has called the enslavement of millions of African people “the necessary evil upon which the union was built”. Tom Cotton, who represents Arkansas, is introducing laws to prohibit use of federal funds to teach the 1619 Project, a project from the New York Times that reframes US history around August 1619 and the arrival of slave ships on American shores for the first time.

8. Health experts call for lift on magic mushroom ingredient
Restrictions on the active ingredient in magic mushrooms are blocking potential treatments for severe depression, addiction and other mental health disorders, scientists and politicians have said. According to clinical trials, psilocybin may be a safe and effective medicine for patients with certain psychiatric illnesses. Experts are urging ministers to order a review of psilocybin and remove the obstacles faced by researchers.

9. Star from Hollywood’s golden age dies at age of 104
Olivia de Havilland, one of the last remaining stars from Hollywood’s “golden age”, has died at the age of 104. During her career, which spanned more than 50 years and almost 50 feature films, she appeared in Gone with the Wind. She was a pivotal figure in getting actors better contracts. At the time of her death she was the oldest living performer to have won an Oscar.

‘The pain in Spain’
Metro talks of “The pain in Spain” as new quarantine measure leave up to 1.5m British tourists currently in Spain or due to travel there “in limbo”. The Daily Mirror says new quarantine measures have caused “holiday hell”.

Covering the government’s anti-obesity drive, the Daily Telegraph tells readers to “Lose 5lbs and save the NHS £100m”. It features a photograph of Boris Johnson walking a dog.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail says the “bombshell” book about Harry and Meghan is likely to “scupper any hopes of renegotiating their royal duties” in the future.

Good Morning Varkeychan,
‘Panta rhei’ said Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher circa 535-475 BCE.

It’s loosely translated into the oft-quoted “change is the only constant in life.”

True then. Even truer today.

Before I go any further, let me introduce myself. I’m Nithin, a fresh face at The Ken and its first dedicated writer for the daily newsletter, Beyond the First Order, shortened to BFO. We write about the changes we see in India – in tech, policy, healthcare, business, and money.

If you remember, my colleague Jum had introduced you to our newsletters a few days ago too.

Today, I’m going to talk about how India is changing, and what it means for all of us. In our lives. In our careers. It affects all of us. Some of us may be employed at a company. Some of us may have struck out on our own. Whether we like it, or not, change is happening, at a pace faster than ever.

Let me show you an example of this change. I’ll illustrate this using a sector I understand and follow quite closely — personal finance.

The graph below shows the average lifespan of companies in the US over the years.


It’s a similar story in India when seen through the lens of its stock market index, the NSE Nifty 50. The index saw 50% of its constituent companies churn over the past decade.

Things change.

And India’s sweeping reforms in 1991 accelerated a lot of these changes.

Suddenly, government run institutions took a back seat. In banking, private banks entered the fray. Today, the once mighty public sector banks are like dinosaurs on the brink of extinction, merging with each other in order to survive. This probably means more job losses, fewer promotions, and more competition for the staff who always felt secure in their jobs.

Shortly after private banks came the non-banking financial companies. They changed the way Indians spent their money. Credit was easy to come by and people’s aspirations grew. Traditional money lenders were hurt. Even private banks started losing out.

When discount brokerages started popping up in 2011, incumbents were quick to write them off, but today the traditional brokers are a dying breed. Soon, engineering teams which never found their place in a stock brokerage formed the backbone of its operations.

Over the years, distributors of mutual funds have seen their earnings dry up as a sea of regulations engulf them. In the 2000s, it was the abolition of entry charges for mutual fund investments and in the 2010s, it was the introduction of lower cost commission free plans along with a distinct regulation of fee-based investment advice. Fintech companies mushroomed to reach investors at scale. Entire lives and careers have been disrupted.

And mutual funds themselves are today at the risk of being disrupted by fintech companies that put the power of investing in the hands of investors. It is also enabling a host of financial experts to reach a greater audience by offering subscription-based investment portfolios.

Change is here. It’s faster than ever. It’s more pronounced than ever. And it’s more impactful than ever.

The only way out is to stay abreast of this change.

Luckily, that’s what we do on a full-time basis at The Ken.
Today’s premium story

Today’s story, which we’re unlocking for you, is about one such change but at a country-wide level.

India is hoping to ride on the $13 billion Adani Group, the world’s largest solar power developer, to take a big leap in solar module and cell production. But, this ambition still has to face China which holds the key to India’s clean energy future.

You see, China is home to 94% of the global production capacity for silicon wafers. A key component of solar production.

With border disputes on the rise and China losing its pole position slowly as the manufacturer for the world, India might have a foot in the door, but it’s an uphill climb and it still needs China.

Read this fascinating tale by Seetharaman.

The Chinese eclipse over India, Adani’s solar manufacturing dreams.

I first heard about The Ken from a colleague at work. Being a consultant, I am constantly researching and learning to advise clients, so the content here was right up my alley!


‘Hey, did you know?” discussions about the day’s story became a sort of a ritual for me and Abhishek at home. When you guys offered the product variation to include a partner, it was a no brainer to share it with yours truly.


One big reason why we are willing to pay for the subscription (aside from the fact that you have awesome research and articulation skills), is that The Ken offers an extremely refreshing and actionable take on a wide range of sectors, that is unbiased and deeply nuanced, even on topics that may well be controversial. This is sadly disappearing from the other mainstream journalism. With The Ken, we find that we can trust the information, make our opinions and have an informed world view, all the while engaged in a conversation with the author.

Good Morning Varkeychan,

It’s Day 25 of the challenge. Just 5 more days to go.

I’m Manan and I’m the Product Manager at The Ken.

Perhaps you’re wondering what a Product Manager does at a company like The Ken — a subscription media publication that has a journalism product. Well, I build products to drive growth and to give our subscribers a great experience. Often, this is neither easy nor straightforward. There are a lot of trade-offs involved. That’s what Product Managers do — they absorb these risks, make decisions and calibrate the results.

Allow me to show you this with an example.

Let’s say you are a media publication that publishes one story a day to your paid subscribers. You send an email to your subscribers every morning with a link to the story on your website. To read it, the subscriber clicks on the link, is taken to the website and can read the story after logging into their account.

What if I told you that this publication that publishes one story a day, which takes a subscriber an average of 10 minutes to read, decided to build a mobile app just six months after launch?

Why did we do this?

Well, initially, our thinking was that the mobile app was a way to replicate the reading experience of a subscriber from the web to an app.

But over time, quite recently, we found out that we were wrong. So three years later, in March 2020, we took an unusual call. We decided to dump our app and rebuild one from scratch.

Why did we do that? Because two things became really clear to us.

    For a subscription publication to succeed, an app isn’t just desirable. It is necessary
    All our earlier assumptions for why we needed to have an app were wrong


    For traditional news publications, the app drives user acquisition. That’s why they focus on app rankings, reviews and ratings.
    For traditional news publications, the app is an engagement channel, to send push notifications and to make users spend more time on it.
    Finally, for traditional news publications, the app is a monetisation channel to show ads.

For a subscription-based publication, the reasons are somewhat different.

In fact, subscription-based publications need an app because it solves problems that only subscription-based publications face.

Most apps where subscribers discover content—Twitter, Facebook, Gmail, WhatsApp, and others—have their own in-app browsers with their own individual session stores. Subscription publications limit the number of simultaneous sessions. Naturally, subscribers end up getting logged out, prompting them to log back in frequently.

Publications go to great lengths to solve this problem. We’ve our own approach, too.

There’s another reason.

At The Ken, longform articles—stories—are our core product. Since last year, when we introduced The Nutgraf, we now have three subscriber newsletters that have quickly become subscriber favourites. And we’re launching a podcast soon.

But for subscribers of The Ken, the app is where it all comes together. Subscribers find the day’s longform story and the day’s newsletters right at the top, seamlessly weaved into the home screen. No reason to go through various apps and websites.

And the way we built it was through feedback from our subscribers.

That’s more or less what Product Managers do. Not just at The Ken, but in most organisations.

They look closely at existing assumptions, and try to think of new ways to solve old problems.

And sometimes, we manage to put a smile on some faces.
Today’s premium story

The story that I’m unlocking today is one that’s close to my heart…and career.

From door-delivery to dog-walking, startups these days have turned everything into a ‘product’ that needs to be sold. But not everyone can sell these products. And not everyone can plan and execute them as well.

With the lines between product and services blurring, there is now a need for a new type of manager—the product manager (PM).

Sometimes they do everything. Sometimes, they don’t have to do anything. Their roles are fluid, changing according to requirements. Which is why you’d be hard-pressed to find a specific job description for these types of jobs.

Project Manager is dead. Long live the Product Manager

But the requirement for them is growing. On Naukri.com—India’s number one job search portal—listings for “product managers” jumped 14% between May 2018 and January 2020. Exactly double the growth of overall job listings on the website.

But even as PMs are being recruited in droves, the role of the project manager, the original PM is slowly growing obsolete. They are from a different era in IT and are not quite equipped to navigate the paradigm shift that products have caused. And now they’re rebranding themselves as PMs.

Today’s story explores this significant new trend in Indian tect and the conflict that this new role has brought on. Why does everyone want to be a PM? What is the future of this career path? What are its requirements?

Project Manager is dead. Long live the Product Manager.

From our subscribers


Other newsletters might be hesitant to write about businesses who advertise with them; you cannot bite the hand that feeds you. The mere fact that The Ken does not accept paid promotions from companies and the Government, is incentive enough for me to read their stories which give an unbiased and nuanced point of view.ost enjoyable for me. The dose of wit is a great bonus.

Good Morning Varkeychan,
Congratulations, you’ve almost made it to the end of The Ken’s 30-day reading challenge. Just two more days to go.


I’m Nadine, one of the writers of The Ken’s Southeast Asia edition. I’m based in Jakarta.

I say uncomfortable, because asking questions about gender discrimination in tech–yes, even in 2020–can still trigger heated debates. However, with that learning, today I’m going to talk a bit about women in the tech industry — in companies, in stories, in regulation and yes, in our newsroom. Not all of you may agree with me, but that’s okay — one of the things I’ve learnt after writing deeply reported stories is that reality is complicated, nuanced, and often, more than one thing can be true at the same time.

None of us can claim perfect knowledge. Even my views have changed over time.

Take for instance the infatuation with the idea of meritocracy. Like many startups, for a long-time, even I believed that the most skilled will make it to the top based on their achievements alone and that factors like gender, ethnicity, or connections don’t play a role. I always believed and trusted that objective methods to support employee’s advancement and measure their achievements not only exist, but are also faithfully followed by all companies big or small.

Much later, I’ve come to accept that meritocracy is a utopia. Even at companies that mean well and want to do the right thing, the notion that they own and operate a system that’s free of all bias seems fanciful at best, and delusional at worst.

I’m not sure if you know this, but over the last few years, the tech industry is coming around to accepting this.

Some understood this easily and readily.

For others, the lessons came at a price.

It took brave women like Susan Fowler (at Uber) and Ellen Pao (at Kleiner Perkins) to draw attention to the persistent problem of gender discrimination in startups and venture capital.

Since then, there’s been a lot of soul-searching and academic research. And there are strong indications that having a diverse workforce is actually good for business.

Of course, tech certainly isn’t the only industry with gender imbalances. There are jobs, like auto mechanics, or primary school teachers, where one gender has a vastly higher representation than the other.


Today’s premium story

The story I’m unlocking for you today is about this topic.

Here’s the context.

Companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, and Tesla are setting the agenda for the future. And a breed of eccentric, aggressive leaders like Zuckerberg, Musk, and Bezos helm these seemingly unstoppable companies.

These companies have become so powerful that society is worried about their market dominance.

Curiously, the voices calling for change and reform in the face of big tech are often female.

Like Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner. Or Lina Khan, an antitrust lawyer. Or Senator Elizabeth Warren. Author Shoshanna Zuboff. Carole Jane Cadwalladr, the journalist who led the reporting on the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The story I encourage you to read today is by Arundhati, The Ken’s longest-serving staff writer.


Lessons for India from three women taking on Google, Facebook and Amazon.

If the rise of big tech was a story dominated by men, maybe the next chapter will be infused with more female voices.

From our subscribers

I love The Ken for keeping the journalism alive! Most online news portals don’t verify facts & publish anything – and offline publications/ TV are all biased / politically or financially motivated – which means doctored news.

Large corporates control how the world perceives them – either through paid promotions or other pressures – The Ken is one of few portals where one can find well researched articles which shows the true – other side of the story.

Staff Eng | Facebook/Airbnb/Pinterest/Square/Stripe/ByteDance | San Francisco | Sept 2020 | Offers


I did a lot of interviews! These were all done remotely because of covid, which I actually prefered. It makes a big difference to not have to commute. Also is pretty great to be able to interview in sweatpants.


My work experience has mostly been in infrastructure, so was applying for roles in that area. Some of the interviews had questions very focused towards that, so want to call this out - I don't expect that everyone would get these types of questions. I was also interviewing for staff level roles, so the balance between system design and coding was different to more starting level interviews. Mention this because no need killing yourself on system design if you're not going for a role that requires it.


I started with some interviews at startups so that I could practice and get over interview jitters. I was also in the process with Google, Lyft and Netflix, but cut them short because I was happy with my offers. I tried to have as many interviews lined up as possible so that I didn't have everything riding on just one of them. As with everything in life, practice really helps.

Because these interviews were all for staff or senior level roles, there was generally a fair bit of back and forth before the onsites, where I had the opportunity to talk to various managers to see if their team was a fit for companies where they hire you into a specific role.



I was previously at Facebook (but more than a year ago), so I did a shortened loop, but still a full onsite.
The double design interview is because I was going for E6.
One question was around a geolocation system and the other around a turnbased gaming setup.
I can't remember the coding questions, but think one round was LC easy+medium, and the second was 2 easy questions.
Behavioural included a very quick coding problem and then was discussing my background and how I work with others.
The design questions are the most important for this level (according to the recruiter). In these, I tried to show end-to-end understanding and then dig in after the interviewer seemed okay with the overall flow.

No screens - they offered to let me go straight to onsite.
The systems design questions were fairly generic - one around caching and cache consistency, the other around distributing files.
Coding questional was practical - log parsing - less LC and more something small that you could actually be expected to do in real life. It was my last interview and I ran out of time.
Behavioral was with the manager and was more like a discussion than a straight interview. No coding.
I think it's unusual that I only had 1 coding round - not sure why.
I was going for a more SRE role, so the questions did lean more towards that. The team I would join interviewed me so it was a good opportunity to get to see who I would be working with. One guy interviewed me from Starbucks, which sucked because I really struggled to hear him.

Coding questions were LC easy and mediums.
System design question was around designing some limited set of Pinterest features. The interviewer was quite interactive, felt much more like a conversation than a straight interview. I enjoyed it.
Domain specific was around the team I was joining. I don't actually have deep experience in this area, so it was more a loose discussion of how my previous experience could apply, how I've dealt with problems in the technical area before, etc.
1 behavioural was with the team manager, and the other was with their head of infrastructure. Both were more like chats.
The behavioural interviews seemed half getting to know me and half selling the team to me. I would guess that I had two of them because I was going for staff level.

Coding question was pretty practical - no LC style coding.
Systems eng pairing was around debugging and running some Kubernetes/Docker setup. I had to ssh into an EC2 instance, share my screen and then work through the questions with the interviewer. I didn't have previous Docker/Kubernetes production experience, which they knew, so it was more around seeing thinking processes in debugging, designing systems, etc.
Sys design was fairly standard.
Previous experience really dug into previous projects of mine, what worked, what didn't, with a focus on the people side of things.
And finally, the sell was a chance for me to talk to a senior leader (and have them sell me on the company).
This was a pretty unusual interview overall. All the interviews had two interviewers in them, one who was shadowing and the other leading it. As I mentioned, I didn't have much experience with the tech used in the systems pairing, but this wasn't an issue as I'd used similar things before and I got the feeling they were interested in my thinking, not whether I remembered specific docker commands, etc. The behavioural was the most indepth one of all the interviews I did - they really got into things and seemed to be looking for very specific attributes. Overall I really enjoyed the interview process (as much as one can enjoy and interview). I hadn't been super sold on Square before, but the interview made me re-evaluate them as an option that I considered seriously.

Coding question was around string manipulation - LC medium
I was asked to prepare a 20min presentation on a previous project I'd done. We then discussed the work, I answered any questions, etc.
System design was fairly standard.
I spoke to both my potential manager and the head of the org. The org head asked pretty probing questions around previous teams, how I worked with people, handled difficulties, etc.
Like the Square interview, this was very unusual compared to the normal idea of interviews. It was a lot more around sys design and explaining my thinking than the others. The presentation took a lot of time to prepare (20min is not very long to describe a year long project+all the context to understand it), but it really allowed me to highlight my skills. I don't think it's accidental that this was my best offer - they really allowed me to show them what I was best at.

2 coding, 1 design, 1 behavioural.
Coding was all LC. 1 easy + 1 medium for each round. For the first of the coding interviews, when I finished early they asked me to describe what happens when you curl a https site.
Sys design was very focused on infosec.
Behavioural went over previous experience.
They did their onsite over 4 separate hour long interviews spread over a few weeks. All the US ban talk was happening at this time - I didn't get a good idea of what the team or work would be like.

Did a single coding phonescreen with Lyft (LC medium), take-home exercise for Netflix + coding screen (this one was strange - LC medium, but he wanted it done in a very specific way), was pushed straight through to onsite for Google because I had a short timeline. I dropped out of the interview processes for all these because I had offers I was happy with.


I did every question in Cracking the Coding Interview and went over the answers until I was sure I understood. This provided a really structured way of learning, because the book is broken into different topics. All the the CTCI questions are on LC, but it really helped to have them structured so that it was clear what I was working on while I ramped up. I then supplemented with LC questions. In my opinion, the coding interviews really come down to pattern recognition. You do enough practice so that when you get a question you haven't heard before you can pattern match it to similar questions, and therefore a technique to solve them. I spent about 2 months on coding prep - couple of hours every day.
For system design, there are a lot of wikis and tutorials out there. I found it really helpful to break things down into storage + compute + communication and then see how those were different for various test problems. Another thing I found really important was finding a way to structure my answer so that the interviewer could follow along - especially since I couldn't use a white board. When I started out I would kind of jump all over the problem space. Practiced being more methodical about how I answered the question to make sure I gave a highlevel overview before diving deep into any component. I also went over some distributed system basics like distributed hashing and how different databases do replication, etc. The biggest help here, though, if I'm honest, was my prior experience - not just systems I'd worked on, but also things other people worked on that I heard about, technical blogs I read and so on. You're not expected to come up with this all from scratch - a lot of smart people have designed a lot of smart things, and by having an idea of what is going on outside my specific area, I was able to borrow those ideas in my interviews.
* I jotted down some answers to typical behavioural questions, so that I had given them some thought beforehand and wasn't just spitballing in the moment.

Finally, practicing the process of interviewing really helps! If there's one suggestion you take away from this, let it be this one! It's really scary beng evaluated by strangers, so having some experience of this, before the big day, really helps. In my case I was able to do some screens with companies that I wasn't super interested in, but in the past I've gotten friends to interview me. The LC mock interviews were also helpful.


Takeaways


    So. Much. Talking. On the phone. And over zoom. So many recruiters. Every recruiter wants to talk to you multiple times and this can really add up - I tried to move as much of this as possible to email because otherwise I would spend hours every week just chatting to recruiters. I did my best to just not do phonecalls with sourcers - you're gonna have to speak to a recruiter as well from the same company, who will go over the same information. Some of this I could get out of, some of it I couldn't, based on the company.

    You can't cram learn the system design stuff. If you're planning to interview for a senior position and don't have a lot of exposure in your role to a variety of large scale, distributed systems then read eng blogs, etc. In many ways I got these offers based on this sys design knowledge - not the stuff I had done, but the things that I had seen others do and could then apply to the novel questions I was given.

    Practice. So much practice. I failed some of my earlier interviews because of nerves. But because they weren't companies I was super excited to work for, it didn't matter as much. Nerves are a real thing! They make your brain mush.

    Tap your whole network - and then tap their networks. The only interview I got because a recruiter reached out to me first was with ByteDance - all the others I found someone who knew someone who knew someone who worked at one of the companies. This was a lot easier since I now live in the Bay Area, but I did the same when I got my first job out here (and was still in my home country). I'm not good at promoting myself, and so this required stepping out of my comfort zone and asking people to recommend me. Not everyone said yes, but enough people did. This played a massive role in me not feeling a ton of pressure for each interview - if I failed this one, it was okay, I had a backup.

    Negotiate! Everyone says this, but really. One of the best ways to negotiate is by having competing offers ;)

    I asked about inclusion and diversity at each company - maybe it doesn't matter a ton to you, but I find it very telling to watch a manager talk about this. Even more so for some of the more senior leaders. You get an idea of how they respond to difficult questions (because no tech company is doing a good job on this), and how much responsibility they take for the culture on their team.


* The best interview experiences I had were at Square and Stripe because they had the interviews that best evaluated my actual abilities. I'm sure it's a lot more effort for them to do it this way, but I really do hope that this is the direction future interviews will go - means you get evaluated over a lot more than just whether you can do a LC medium in 45min.


The point I made above about time spent on the phone applies triply here. With staff positions, the recruiter will generally assume you also want to talk to potential managers (or the director of the org you're looking at). It's not just about getting th job, but also about finding a role which matches your background. So, there will be a ton of calls before you even get to the interview stage. The nicest bit about interviewing at this level is that they will be trying to sell the company to you, so really do ask the questions you need to to figure out whether you'll be able to be successful in the role.

Have an answer for what you're looking for in your next role - everyone asks this.
Have a solid leadership story with as much scope as possible. Generally they're hiring you based on what you've done, not your future potential. This bit is super important - be sure of your narrative, and able to clearly define what you did vs others (whether this be code/design/project management/etc). Ideally have it be something where you came up with the idea, did a significant amount of the project management and where multiple teams were involved. It doesn't have to be something that you owned completely, but it does need to be something where you took significant ambiguity and set direction. For example, in my case, I lead the software side of a broader hardware project. I defined the success metrics, feature set, operational changes, deployment work, etc etc. I didn't design the hardware, or decide on the original goal (which is tough at a FAANG company since they're huge), but I took the goal and then figured out was needed from the teams in my area.
* Within this, it's really important to show self reflection and insight - what did you struggle with, what do you wish you had done differently, what was the most challenging part, give an example of conflict and how it was resolved, etc.
* It is impossible to have gotten everything right - be able to talk about your failures, but, make sure you do so with insight so that you can show growth.
* Don't talk badly about your coworkers - there is a diplomatic way to frame even the worst transgressions.
* Because I don't have like 20 years of experience, I don't have a ton of projects that I led at the staff scope, so I would often borrow bits and pieces from other work of mine to answer questions - for example, ""provide an example of a time you disagreed about technical direction and how it was resolved"" -> this doesn't have to be on a huge project. I was trying to show some range in what I worked on, so would pull answers to things like this from other projects I worked on outside of only the ones I completely led.
Have stories around mentorship and growing other engineers. This can be one on one, or org wide initiatives. Org wide would be things like programs to improve interview quality, tech talks, mentorship programs, diversity work. Things that demonstrate setting ""culture"".
Be able to quanitify the scale of your work - ""this tool was used by 75% of engineers"", ""This handled 50Tb/s of traffic"", etc.
I would say try to demonstrate either technical depth, or breadth. If you have only worked in one area, try find ways to demonstrate how you have exceptional depth in it. If you've worked in a number, use your answers to talk about your work across multiple areas.
Have some prepared questions for them around org setup, culture, etc.
You can really guide a lot of these behavioural interviews - show interviewers your best attributes.
Be friendly!! They have to want to work with you.

You've got to nail system design. You're expected to be able to code, but you're adding value at the system design layer.
Be able to show technical depth in your area
Be able to talk about disaster recovery, designing for failure, graceful degredation, etc.
Have examples where you led the meta-initaitives in a broader program to reduce risk. These are all the additional process changes that need to happen to get a big change out. So, with my background in infrastructure, this was all the operational parts of releasing something new (deployment, testing, monitoring, alarming, oncall, provisioning, capacity estimates, division of responsibility, etc). All the technical processes to manage people and risk.
When doing the system design interviews, be able to give the whole system overview before diving in to any specific component. I also got questions here around things like deployment and monitoring (what metrics would you use to check deployment health, how would you pace the deployment, etc), but this may be due to my background.
For FAANG and many others, its expected that you are still doing technical work as a staff eng - so being able to talk about the parts of the system that you directly worked on is a plus.



It's really easy to be completely overwhelmed in this area, so honestly, I would start with some sort of guide like the one above and then move through it. Pretty much every concept described in the github page above has had some company opensource their solution, normally with a nicely written blog post that explains the rationale and the chosen solution. Try go for breadth before you go for depth.

Something else to be aware of, is that its okay to be stronger in some areas than others. For example, I can talk endlessly about certain areas, but for example, while I know the HTTP verbs, I couldn't tell you the last time I inspected a POST request, because I haven't worked on a webserver in years - and this shows in my sys design interviews - I quickly skip on to the services side of things. Most interviewers will follow where you lead them (as long as it makes sense).

In terms of specific sources, since I was at Facebook, I kept up with a lot of the internal work there which often ended up on the eng blog. I also kept an eye on big new product releases from AWS, since they almost always match a problem AWS had to solve internally. There is often some description of what problem was being solved, and why.
Looking at what companies do wrt disaster recovery is also pretty interesting - looking at how things could fail tells you a lot about how to design for resiliency. Netflix and its chaos monkeys are a great start. Facebook, Google, etc all have robust DR/chaos engineering programs that they blog about.
Something else I can suggest is figuring out why various things become popular, what problem they solve, and how. For example, why docker? What does kubernetes provide? What would you use kafka for? Memcache? Once you understand a bit about some technology, you start to see all the places where it could be used as a solution.

Finally, if you do decide to follow a company specific blog, I would suggest going with a midsize company rather than something like Google. Google is solving problems only Google has. And its solving so many problems that there are tons and tons of topics covered. Smaller companies are solving problems many companies have, and are likely hitting problems you'd need to know in a systems interview (for example, how to improve your loadbalancing vs, say, laying undersea cables like Google or Facebook).

But again, it's really easy to get overwhelmed. Pick a guide, there are tons, and then stick to it as a start. Hope this helps!

The restrictions that could be lifted by May
Outdoor socialising may be allowed within weeks
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Today’s newspaper front pages are the most optimistic we’ve seen since the discovery of the Kent coronavirus variant before Christmas.

While there’s little doubt that vaccines are changing the rules of the game, it may be a sign of our diminished expectations that the idea of outdoor dining at the end of March is generating quite such enthusiasm.

hope springs eternal
The restrictions lined up to be lifted by May
The lockdown in England will begin to lift within weeks under “tentative” plans being drawn up by ministers hoping for a “quick return to normal” in the wake of the vaccines rollout, according to reports.

Government sources have told The Times that outdoor socialising and sports will be the first activities to get the green light from Boris Johnson after children return to school in March. 

Open-air markets and al-fresco dining are also expected to to be allowed to resume at around the same time, “but high-street shops and indoor dining will have to wait”, says the Daily Mail.

‘Too early’ to book summer holidays
PM warns against planning getaways in the sun
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

With the country back in lockdown, it now seems unthinkable that 2020 saw thousands heading for holidays across the UK.

Those hoping to repeat their trip this year should hold off a little longer, after Boris Johnson said “it is just too early for people to be certain about what we’ll be able to do this summer”.

The PM has promised to shed more light on holidaying after 22 February, when he reveals his long-awaited roadmap out of lockdown.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . ‘Too early’ to book summer holidays
Boris Johnson has warned Brits that it is “too early” to book summer holidays - even within the UK. His comments follow a string on contradictory advice from ministers, causing widespread confusion. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps yesterday said that nobody should be planning a summer holiday either in Britain or abroad. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed earlier in the day that he had booked a getaway in Cornwall and was “optimistic” about the summer. Travel company Tui has said it expects to run 80% of its normal capacity for this summer, with 2.8 million customers already booked for its holidays.

2 . ‘Horror’ videos at Trump trial
Senators presiding over Donald Trump’s historic second impeachment trial have been shown never before seen footage of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by his supporters. Police inside the building are seen ushering politicians to safety in the video, sometimes within yards of rioters. The impeachment prosecutors took senators on a “wrenching journey” inside the “horror” of the insurrection, CNN says. However, Trump is expected to be acquitted as most Republican senators are likely to vote against impeachment.

3 . Kent Covid to ‘sweep the world’
The Covid mutation first discovered in Kent is likely to become the world’s dominant strain, according to the head of the UK’s genetic surveillance programme. Professor Sharon Peacock told the BBC that the new variant has “swept the country” and will “sweep the world, in all probability”. The professor of public health and microbiology at Cambridge University also said her work sequencing new variants of the virus could be required for at least a decade. The Kent variant has so far been detected in more than 50 countries.

4 . Amsterdam overtakes London on trade
Amsterdam leapfrogged London as Europe’s largest share trading centre last month as the UK’s departure from the EU led to a shift in dealing of stocks and derivatives. An average €9.2b (£8bn) shares were traded a day on Euronext Amsterdam and the Dutch arms of CBOE Europe and Turquoise in January, more than a fourfold increase on December. Anish Puaar, a market construction analyst at Rosenblatt Securities in London, said that the development is “symbolic”, adding that London “has a chance to carve out its own niche on trading”.

5 . PM ‘betrayal’ over cladding
Campaigners have accused Boris Johnson of betraying homeowners after ministers unveiled a £3.5bn fund to remove flammable cladding that could leave an estimated half a million people still facing financial peril. The Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said that homeowners in blocks less than 18 metres tall would be left out of the fund and will be offered low-interest loans instead. The funding comes four years after the devastating Grenfell Tower fire, which left 72 people dead and more than 200 households homeless.

6 . Green revolution ‘could cost $13tn’
A new report has said that oil and gas producing countries face a multi-trillion-dollar hole in their government revenues as the world cuts back on the use of fossil fuels. The report, published by the think tank Carbon Tracker, says some countries could lose at least 40% of total government revenue, adding that its data should serve as a “wake-up call” to oil producing countries and global policymakers.

7 . Flying taxis within five years
United Airlines plans to buy 200 flying electric taxis to ferry passengers to airports within the next five years. The US carrier will also invest in flying taxi firm Archer as part of a $1.1bn (£800m) deal to develop the small aircraft. The taxis will be capable of flying a distance of 60 miles at 150 miles an hour. “With the right technology, we can curb the impact aircraft have on the planet, but we have to identify the next generation of companies who will make this a reality early and find ways to help them get off the ground,” United Airlines chief executive Scott Kirby said.

8 . Scandal-hit drugs boss given OBE

9 . MP threatens court action on leave
A Labour MP is threatening to take the government to court over a bill giving six months’ paid maternity leave to cabinet ministers only. Stella Creasy said the proposed arrangement would effectively award better maternity rights as a reward for political promotion, describing it as being “like a company car”. Creasy, who is pregnant with her second child, pioneered a system of having a “locum MP” in place when she had her first child. Her threat comes as the government moves to change the law to allow Attorney General Stella Braverman to take paid leave.

10 . Springsteen arrested on drink driving
Bruce Springsteen was arrested in New Jersey last year and charged with driving while intoxicated and reckless driving, officials have revealed. The singer was also cited for consuming alcohol in a closed area of a national park on the same day, 14 November. Celebrity news site TMZ says the veteran rock star is due to appear in court in the next few weeks. His song “The Rising” last year featured prominently in Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.

Today’s newspapers
‘Give us a break’
“Give us a break”, pleads the Daily Mirror’s splash this morning after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that it is too soon to start making holiday plans for this summer. “Hols on hold” is Metro’s take on the story, as it says millions of people have been “left in limbo” after already booking holiday plans.

The Times leads on a call from Boris Johnson for the final two million unvaccinated people who are over 70 or work in healthcare to come forward for a jab. “Now is the moment to do it,” he tells them.

And the Financial Times leads on reports that Amsterdam overtook London to become Europe’s largest share trading centre last month. The paper says there has been a “fourfold surge” in business in the Dutch capital as it mops up trade lost after the UK left the EU.

How to get up to 50% tax relief – free factsheet for investors
The end of the tax year is in just five weeks. But there is still time for experienced investors to invest tax‑efficiently and get up to 50% tax relief.

How? This is possible when you invest in young, innovative job‑creating businesses through VCTs, EIS or SEIS. The government introduced these schemes (with valuable tax reliefs attached) to incentivise investment in these types of business – and in recognition of the high risks.

Save tax this year or get back tax already paid

You could get up to 30–50% income tax and capital gains tax relief by backing some of the UK’s most promising – albeit high risk – young companies.

What’s more, you could potentially use the tax relief in the current tax year or even get back tax you’ve already paid for the last – but you must act swiftly, before 5 April.

Read a quick summary and comparison of the relevant tax treatment for experienced investors in our free factsheet.

The trade-off is that if you are a high net worth individual or sophisticated investor you could enjoy significant benefits.
 
This free factsheet is not advice or a personal recommendation, but it explains the main facts you need to know, so you can decide if these opportunities are for you.

Yours sincerely

Failure to secure main conviction could see other accused officers walk free

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin continues this afternoon, a day after jurors heard opening arguments and witness testimony on the killing of George Floyd.

One witness was a 911 dispatcher who said officers pinned Floyd down for so long she thought her security video feed had frozen.

Despite the footage, prosecutors face a number of challenges in what has become a crucial juncture for America’s race relations.

George Floyd
The challenges for prosecutors in the Derek Chauvin trial
Derek Chauvin’s use of force against George Floyd was “unattractive but necessary”, lawyers for the former Minnesota police officer have argued at the opening of his murder trial.

Defence lawyer Eric Nelson told the jury yesterday that “the evidence is far greater than nine minutes and 29 seconds” of video footage showing Floyd’s death during his arrest last May by police including Chauvin, who denies all of the charges against him.

As demonstrators rallied outside the Minneapolis court, the first prosecution witness later testified that Floyd was “slowly fading away” as Chauvin kneeled on his neck. “His eyes slowly rolled to the back of his head” until “he didn’t have no life in him no more”, the witness said.

A guide to Alex Salmond’s new Alba Party
Scotland’s biggest political parties will take part in the first televised leadership debate tonight ahead of May’s Holyrood election next month - but one absent new leader is likely to overshadow the evening.

Alex Salmond is returning to front-line politics as the chief of newly formed pro-independence party Alba - the Scottish-Gaelic name for Scotland. The former first minister’s long-running feud with his successor Nicola Sturgeon has threatened to hobble the nationalist cause, but he is now vowing to help build “a super-majority for independence” in the Scottish Parliament.

Starmer’s squad
As Keir Starmer approaches his first anniversary as Labour leader, rumours of a shadow cabinet reshuffle are rife.

While Starmer has insisted that his team is “absolutely focused” on the May elections, insiders have suggested that a shake-up of at least some posts is likely as the party continues to lag behind the Tories. With the latest YouGov Westminster voting intention figures giving the Conservatives a nine-point lead over Labour, here are some of the opposition party’s potential candidates for demotions or promotions.

‘Even Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen would blush at Johnson’s new press room’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “Big day in Downing Street,” writes Henry Deedes in the Daily Mail. Not because of yesterday’s “soft-soap” lockdown easing, but “the grand unveiling of Boris Johnson’s new White House-style press room, built for such a costly sum (£2.6 million) the wallpaper may well have been woven from the thread produced by caviar-fed silkworms”, Deedes writes. “First thoughts on the decor? Bright. Very bright”. Even “Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen might have blushed at the brilliant blue lustre used as background”. Its oak panelling “reminded me of Judge Rinder’s daytime TV set. Or was it more Premier Inn?”, he wonders. Either way, “the setting may have been new but otherwise much of what the PM had to say was painfully familiar”.

How to watch, what to watch and whom to watch.
	
 
	
	10 for Today 	
		The 2018 Winter Olympic Games begin tonight in frigid PyeongChang with a combined South and North Korea team marching in the parade of nations at the Opening Ceremony. The local Olympic organizing committee is handing out blankets and hot-packs in hopes that the spectators will survive the cold. There are four new sports and six new nations at these Games, with several stars like Lindsey Vonn, Shaun White and Mikaela Shiffrin, hoping to add to their gold medal count. Though figure skating will command center stage, we will also be watching ski jumping, short track skating and bobsled, all sports that get attention but once every four years. The Winter Games are the fun games, a 17-day journey to meet new faces.

Dear Flipboard Community, |
	Flipboard 	
		Dear Flipboard Community, 	
		We are writing to let you know about a security incident we recently identified and addressed involving a subset of user data. We know transparency is important to our community, and we want to share with you what we have learned from our investigation, measures we have taken, as well as steps you can take. 	
		What happened 	
		We recently identified unauthorized access to some of our databases containing certain Flipboard users’ account information, including account credentials. In response to this discovery, we immediately launched an investigation and an external security firm was engaged to assist. Findings from the investigation indicate an unauthorized person accessed and potentially obtained copies of certain databases containing Flipboard user information between June 2, 2018 and March 23, 2019 and between April 21 - 22, 2019. 	
		What information was involved 	
		The databases involved may have contained your name, Flipboard username, cryptographically protected password and email address. 	
		Flipboard has always cryptographically protected passwords using a technique known by security experts as “salted hashing”. The benefit of hashing passwords is that we never need to store the passwords in plain text. Moreover, using a unique salt for each password in combination with the hashing algorithms makes it very difficult and requires significant computer resources to crack these hashed passwords. If you created or changed your password after March 14, 2012, it is hashed with a function called bcrypt. If you have not changed your password since then, it is uniquely salted and hashed with SHA-1. 	
		Additionally, if you connected your Flipboard account to a third-party account, including social media accounts, then the databases may have contained digital tokens used to connect your Flipboard account to that third-party account. We have not found any evidence the unauthorized person accessed third-party account(s) connected to your Flipboard accounts. As a precaution, we have replaced or deleted all digital tokens. 	
		Importantly, we do not collect from users, and this incident did not involve, Social Security numbers or other government-issued IDs, bank account, credit card, or other financial information. 	
		What we are doing 	
		As a precaution, we have reset all users’ passwords, even though the passwords were cryptographically protected and not all users’ account information was involved. You can continue to use Flipboard on devices from which you are already logged in. When you access your Flipboard account from a new device, or the next time you log into Flipboard after logging out of your account, you will be asked to create a new password. 	
		As another precautionary step, we disconnected tokens used to connect to all third-party accounts, and in collaboration with our partners, we replaced all digital tokens or deleted them where applicable. 	
		Additionally, to help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we implemented enhanced security measures and continue to look for additional ways to strengthen the security of our systems. We also notified law enforcement. 	
		What you can do 	
		You can continue to use Flipboard without further action. However, next time you log into your account, you will notice your Flipboard account password needs to be updated. You will find instructions on our support page (linked below) explaining how to create a new password. Also, if you use the same username and password you created for Flipboard for any other online service, we recommend you change your password there, too. 	
		If you connected your Flipboard account to a third-party account to see its content, you may notice in some cases that you need to reconnect it. On our support page you will also find instructions for how to do this. 	
		Where to find more information 	
		We deeply regret this incident happened. For more information and answers to frequently asked questions, we have created a support page with more details about the incident. 	
		Sincerely,
The Flipboard team

‘Get a grip’ - U-turns test backbenchers’ patience
Dissatisfaction sweeps through Conservative MPs
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

A U-turn is not always a bad thing, and polling suggests that most people are willing to forgive a government that changes its mind now and again - especially if the world is changing around it.

But with a summary of recent reversals now running to seven paragraphs, it’s little surprise that MPs and voters alike are getting restless.

‘get a grip’
Johnson’s U-turns test backbenchers’ patience
Back in December, with Boris Johnson commanding a majority of 80 after a landslide election victory, he found himself the toast of a grateful Conservative Party on the verge of delivering Brexit.

But eight months on, and with a string of high-profile U-turns behind him, the prime minister is coming under fire from his own side.

Tory MPs have accused Johnson of presiding over an “utter s***show” following another U-turn on face masks in schools, the Daily Mail says, warning that Downing Street needs to “get a grip”.

“The logic of imposing quarantine is that the threat of spreading the virus on return is significant, justifying drastic restrictions on freedom, havoc for the struggling travel industry and huge costs for those who must isolate but cannot work from home... Yet the system for overseeing and enforcing quarantine is a shabby, incoherent mess, because nobody has designed it to be anything else.”

Could Italy leave the EU after coronavirus?

PANDEMIC FALLOUT
Could Italy leave the EU after coronavirus?
Italy has felt the full force of the coronavirus pandemic, with almost 290,000 cases and more than 35,000 deaths. And now, as the country tries return to some semblance of normality, a new threat to the status quo is emerging. 

Italians have been losing faith in the EU since their nation became the front line of the European migrant crisis in 2015, with Eurosceptic parties gaining significant ground in recent elections.

But the final straw for many voters may be the perceived failure by the EU to help Rome at the height of the health crisis, with some commentators claiming that Brussels’ response amounted to no less than an “abandonment” of Italy.

How Johnson headed off a Brexit rebellion
Downing Street has brokered a deal with Conservative MPs who balked at Boris Johnson’s plans to effectively break international law by overriding parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. 

The prime minister has agreed to amend the UK Internal Market Bill to allow MPs a vote before the government could activate powers in the legislation to override the EU divorce deal - a move that “could stave off a possible rebellion over the issue”, says the BBC.

How France is handling its coronavirus spike
Ministers are facing legal action over virus policy

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

In the spring, Britain looked to Italy and Spain for a preview of the coming pandemic. Now, with infections rising steadily - and care homes preparing for a new wave of Covid patients - France may provide a glimpse of the future.

How France is handling its coronavirus spike
The French government is facing calls to take urgent action to stem a spike in coronavirus cases that has triggered fears of so-called second wave of infections.

France’s Health Ministry reported a 10,593 new Covid cases on Thursday - the highest daily tally since the pandemic began - “prompting officials to urge people to limit social gatherings and maintain handwashing and other protective measures”, says Paris-based news agency AFP.

But despite the surge in outbreaks, President Emmanuel Macron and other leading politicians are reluctant to reimpose a national lockdown, saying that citizens must instead “learn to live with” with the virus.

Care homes brace for new influx of Covid patients
As Covid-19 continues to spread through the UK population, care homes have been told to prepare themselves for fresh outbreaks, more restrictions on visits - and increasing pressure to admit patients who may have the virus.

“If we see similar pressures on the hospital sector this time around then it will be commonplace under the current guidance that people who are Covid-positive will be discharged back into care homes,” Professor Adam Gordon of the British Geriatrics Society told Channel 4 News.

White privilege theory ‘damaging working-class boys’
MPs told that concept leaves poorer white children with ‘status deficit’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The debate about white privilege has reached the Commons Education Select Committee, where a pair of academics said the concept could hold back the poorest white children.

The argument taps into complex connections between race, wealth and education. While many ethnic minorities children do appear to be poorly served by schools, white working-class boys are among the most disadvantaged.

Even that doesn’t tell the whole story. Every group is made up of many other small groups and individuals, some more privileged than others.

status deficit
White privilege theory ‘hurts working-class boys’
Pressure to apologise for “white privilege” is pushing white working-class boys even further “behind everyone else”, MPs have been warned.

Professor Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor at the University of Kent, told the Commons Education Select Committee yesterday that “over the last ten years our national conversation has become more consumed about other groups in society”.

White working-class boys, who are among the worst educational performers, are landed with “a status deficit” and made “to feel as though they are not being given as much recognition and esteem as others”, Goodwin said.

The treatment, produced by US drug company Eli Lilly, is “similar to one taken by US President Donald Trump this month”, says the Financial Times. It involves an infusion of “monoclonal antibodies” - artificially produced cells that mimic the human body’s natural immune response to the coronavirus.

Is it time the EU took on ‘illiberal democracy’?
Dispute over Covid package deepens divisions
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

British opponents of the EU have often characterised it as a band of elite liberals bent on imposing their permissive values across the continent.

When put to the test, however, Brussels has proved powerless to prevent a sharp rightward turn in both Hungary and Poland - even as their repressive populist governments provoke criticism from more conventional conservative politicians elsewhere in Europe.

Is it time the EU took on ‘illiberal democracy’?
Calls for the European Union to clip the wings of Hungary and Poland have reemerged after the two countries vetoed approval of a Brussels budget and Covid-19 recovery package worth £1.8 trillion.

In a meeting on Monday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki announced that they would block the package citing the EU’s “woke” agenda and perceived interference in domestic politics.

The bloc has repeatedly criticised the countries’ slide towards right-wing authoritarianism over the past decade, during which both have restricted civil liberties and curtailed political dissent.

His ambitions will be funded by a £16.5bn rise in defence spending over the next four years, amounting to an increase of about 10% in the annual budget.

“On one level, this is a story about governmental failure. To control a pandemic you need public buy-in. A company chief executive may be able, at least for a time, to send down diktats that have to be obeyed. But when implementing lockdown and quarantines, ‘command and control’ only takes you so far. Citizens have to be persuaded to follow the rules.”

Oxford vaccine is 70% effective
Third injection joins the battle against coronavirus
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

A third consecutive Monday brings positive news of a vaccine, although in this case not quite the unqualified success we have come to expect.

A month ago, the Oxford vaccine’s 70% protection rate would have been welcomed without reservation. Now, after Pfizer and Moderna’s 95% effective efforts, it looks a little less impressive.

But since the Oxford injection is cheaper and easier to make and distribute, it may yet do more to end the pandemic - especially in poorer countries.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Oxford coronavirus vaccine is 70% effective
Results from the Phase 3 trials of a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca have found that it prevents Covid-19 in 70% of people who receive it. The result “is both a triumph and a disappointment”, says the BBC, after two other vaccines, produced by Moderna and Pfizer, protected 95% of recipients. However, the Oxford vaccine is significantly cheaper and easier to distribute.

2. Gyms and shops to re-open when lockdown ends
Boris Johnson is expected to announce later today that gyms and non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen when England’s lockdown ends next month. The 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants will be relaxed and a ban on outdoor grassroots sport is also set to be lifted on 2 December, but other aspects of the three-tier system are expected to be tightened.

3. Mass testing to tackle post-lockdown outbreaks
The government has announced that mass testing is to be rolled out to areas of England with the highest infection rates after lockdown is lifted. The programme will include an exemption scheme for people who have come into close contact with someone who has Covid-19 but go on to test negative, so they won't have to isolate for 14 days.

4. Ally tells Trump to drop his bid to reverse election results
Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and a leading ally of Donald Trump has called on the US president to drop his efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the presidential election. Christie described Trump’s legal team as a “national embarrassment” and said that “elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen”.

5. Sunak says Covid fallout ‘must be grappled with’
Chancellor Rishi Sinak has said that his planned public sector pay freeze does not signal a return of austerity, and argued that his spending plans will result in more money for health, education and the police. However, he has also warned that people will soon see an “economic shock laid bare,” telling the BBC that record government borrowing to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic must be “grappled with”.

6. Ethiopian PM gives Tigrayan leaders ultimatum
Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, has given forces in the northern region of Tigray 72 hours to surrender as government troops advance, warning them that they are “at a point of no return”. The Tigray People's Liberation Front, which controls the mountainous region, insists it will continue to fight. The conflict is thought to have killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks.

7. Nicolas Sarkozy to face historic corruption trial
The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is to go on trial accused of corruption and influence-peddling, after allegedly trying to bribe a magistrate in return for information about an investigation into his party finances. The case is the first of several investigations into the man who led France between 2007 and 2012 - and the first former leader to appear in the dock in recent times.

8. Trump lets Israeli spy leave the US
An American navy intelligence figure, who served 30 years in prison for spying for Israel, is expected to leave the US after having his parole terms lifted. The release of Jonathan Pollard, 66, is said to be a gift from the Trump administration - and has caused anger in the intelligence community. “It’s going to be pretty damn annoying if this traitor gets a celebratory hero’s welcome in Tel Aviv,” said a former CIA officer.

9. Ice Bucket challenge founder dies at 37
One of the men behind the viral Ice Bucket Challenge fundraising campaign has died at the age of 37. Patrick Quinn was diagnosed with the incurable neurological disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as motor neurone disease) in 2013. “He was a blessing to us all in so many ways,” said his supporters on his official Facebook page. The campaign has raised more than £16om for ALS research.

10. Bob Dylan letters raise fortune at auction
A collection of Bob Dylan memorabilia including letters, unpublished writing and handwritten lyrics, have sold for nearly half a million dollars at auction. The items, including the lyrics to Blowin’ In The Wind, were put up for sale in a week-long auction run by RR Auction Company. The auction house said its client was “thrilled” with the prices fetched.

‘Christmas is saved’
“Christmas is saved,” says the Daily Express as Boris Johnson prepares to announce the relaxation of measures so families can meet at Christmas. The Daily Mirror agrees that mingling during the festive season has got the “go ahead” but adds that there are fears that households will spread the virus.

Meanwhile, the Financial Times points out that Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that the UK will have to tackle “the scale of the economic shock” caused by the pandemic.

“We will miss him so much,” is Metro’s headline as it reports on news that Prince William and Kate’s dog Lupo has died. The nine-year-old black cocker spaniel was a wedding present from Kate’s brother, James Middleton.

Why the WHO is warning of a third wave in Europe
Envoy cautions against lifting restrictions too early
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

World leaders are struggling to calibrate their coronavirus messaging amid increasing optimism about vaccines - and fears they might come too late to prevent a third wave.

The UK government hopes that mass testing and a stricter tier system will keep outbreaks under control, but the WHO says further lockdowns may yet be needed.

Why the WHO is warning of a third wave in Europe
Europe may face a third deadly wave of coronavirus in early 2021 if governments lift lockdown measures too early, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Covid-19 envoy has warned.

Speaking to Swiss newspaper Solothurner Zeitung, Dr David Nabarro said that governments had “missed building up the necessary infrastructure during the summer months, after they brought the first wave under control”.

“Now we have the second wave. If they don’t build the necessary infrastructure, we’ll have a third wave early next year,” London-born Nabarro continued. “Another element that is very clear in East Asia is that once you have brought down the case number... you don’t relax the measures.”

Will the Oxford vaccine end the pandemic?
A coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford is between 70% and 90% effective at preventing people from getting Covid-19, according to preliminary data.

Results from Phase 3 trials show that the vaccine, made in partnership with Cambridge-based company AstraZeneca, is 70.4% effective on average. But researchers say that when administered at a half dose and then a full dose, rather than two full doses, the vaccine can be up to 90% effective.

Nice, too, to brief that NHS workers who saved his life in April would be spared from a public sector wage freeze, as it was for Mr Sunak to airily declare there would be no return to austerity.”

How anti-vaxxers could undermine immunity push
xperts warn that growing wave of scepticism could ruin ‘whole programme’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Before herd immunity became the subject of vitriolic debate, the term usually referred to the benign result of vaccinating most but not all of a population.

We may soon be able to revive that meaning. Or we may just stumble into another argument, about how many people need to get the vaccine before we all benefit - and what to do about those who refuse.

How anti-vaxxers could undermine immunity push
A series of successes in clinical trials is raising hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine will soon be approved by regulators and rolled out to communities worldwide. 

Not everybody is keen to be innoculated against the deadly virus, however, with a growing chorus of anti-vax protesters voicing objections. 

What are anti-vaxxers saying?
Suspicion of vaccinations is nothing new, but with the coronavirus continuing to claim thousands of lives every day, “conspiracy theories and misinformation fuelled by populism and social media threaten to undermine herd immunity”, The Times reports.

Rishi Sunak’s public sector pay freeze slammed by unions
Firefighters, police, teachers and local authority staff hit by pay standstill
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

When considering Rishi Sunak’s meteoric rise, it is perhaps worth remembering comic Caroline Aherne’s famous quip to Debbie McGee, wife of television magician Paul Daniels.

“So what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?”

While dolling out funds to support Britain through the pandemic, Sunak’s popularity has risen beyond that even of Boris Johnson. But as reality bites, the Conservative’s rising star may soon become the face of a series of painful cuts.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Sunak’s public sector pay freeze slammed by unions
Unions have described a pay freeze for millions of UK workers as “a kick in the teeth”, after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that he would “pause” pay rises for workers including firefighters, police, teachers and local authority staff. The GMB union said it would “hit key workers who have risked everything during the pandemic”, while the Trades Union Congress said it added to “a decade of standstill pay”.

2. Joe Biden fires Brexit warning at Boris Johnson
Joe Biden has ratcheted up the pressure on Boris Johnson to agree a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union, reiterating his belief that there can be no hard border on the island of Ireland. The president-elect said he had talked to Johnson and EU figures to restate his opposition to a hard border, adding the “idea of having a border north and south once again being closed is just not right”.

3. Football stars pay tribute to ‘beautiful’ Diego Maradona
Tributes have been pouring in for footballing legend Diego Maradona who died yesterday at the age of 60. “To be Diego Maradona was incredibly beautiful”, said Argentine teammate Ossie Ardilles. Brazilian football star Pele said he hoped one day they would “play ball together in the sky”. Maradona’s body will lie in state at the Casa Rosada, the seat of the Argentina government, during three days of mourning.

4. Hancock to outline new post-lockdown tier system
The majority of England will enter the two toughest tiers of Boris Johnson’s new Covid restrictions from next week. The tiered system will be stricter than the previous one, with more local authorities placed under harsh restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the plans in the Commons today, with a review of the rules promised by 16 December amid signs of a growing Conservative rebellion.

5. Over-55s losing trust in the BBC
Older, more well-off viewers are slowly falling out of love with the BBC, Ofcom has revealed. The regulator said Britons spent an average of two hours and 22 minutes a day with the national broadcaster’s television, radio and digital services last year, down 19 minutes since 2017. The proportion of over-55s with a positive impression of the BBC, however, has slipped from 64% to 62% in two years.

6. Controversy as Trump pardons ex-aide Michael Flynn
Donald Trump has pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The White House said that the pardon would finally end “the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man”. Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia’s envoy in 2017, but had tried to withdraw his plea. Trump is expected to pardon a string of key aides before he leaves office.

7. Lawyer complains Ghislaine Maxwell is woken every 15 minutes
Ghislaine Maxwell is being woken every 15 minutes in jail to check that she is alive, according to a letter filed by her attorney. Bobbi Sternheim claims that “despite non-stop in-cell camera surveillance”, Maxwell’s sleep is “disrupted every 15 minutes when she is awakened by a flashlight”. Maxwell stands accused of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls. She has pleaded not guilty.

8. Marcus Rashford to receive special BBC gong
Manchester United and England star Marcus Rashford will be honoured with a special award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The honour will recognise Rashford’s campaigning against child poverty and in support of free school meals. The 23-year-old had been excluded from the main nominees as his on-field achievements have not reached the sporting bar required by the judging panel.

‘He’s in the hands of God’
“He’s in the hands of God,” is the Daily Mirror’s headline this morning following the death of Argentine football legend Diego Maradona. Metro and The Sun run similar headlines, inspired by the words of the BBC’s Gary Lineker.

“This is going to hurt, Britain” is the Daily Mail’s splash, as it leads on Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spending review. The Times says that the chancellor has warned that Britain’s finances face an “emergency”, while The Guardian forecasts the “biggest UK slump in 30 years”.

MPs to debate tiered Covid restrictions
Bill is likely to pass - but Labour will abstain
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Labour will not vote with the government to introduce new coronavirus restrictions this evening - the first time it is withholding support.

Nor will Keir Starmer oppose the rules outright. Instead his party will abstain - a move he says is calibrated to express doubts about the government’s testing and economic support strategy  without blocking attempts to control the “serious threat” posed by Covid-19.

The absence of Labour votes will also serve to lay bare Conservative divisions about the PM’s approach.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Commons expected to approve tiers despite Tory uprising
MPs are preparing to vote on the government's proposals for stricter tiers of coronavirus restrictions across England. Although up to 50 Tory MPs are expected to rebel, the vote is still expected to pass. Labour will abstain - the first time during the pandemic that Keir Starmer will not support the government in a key vote. More than 55 million people will enter the two toughest tiers from on Wednesday if the plans are approved.

2. Amazon deforestation ‘soars to a 12-year high’
Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has surged to its highest level since 2008. Inpe, the country’s space agency, says a total of 4,281 square miles of rainforest were destroyed between August 2019 and July 2020 - a 9.5% increase from the previous year. The carbon store in the Amazon slows down the pace of global warming.

3. Green’s ‘failure’ as Arcadia enters administration
Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group collapsed into administration yesterday, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. The owner of household names including Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Burton appointed administrators from Deloitte, which protects Arcadia from creditors while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. The Guardian says Green’s high street career has ended “in failure”.

4. Grenfell insulation chief ‘sneered at safety concerns’
A boss at a firm whose flammable insulation was fitted on Grenfell Tower said that customers concerned about the safety of the product could “go f*** themselves”, a public inquiry has heard. The Grenfell Tower inquiry was told that Kingspan marketed its product as suitable for buildings above 18 metres tall despite not having safety data to back up the claim.

5. Venues may turn unvaccinated customers away
Restaurants, bars, sporting venues and cinemas may turn customers away if they have not had the Covid-19 jab, according to the new minister for the mass vaccine roll-out. Nadhim Zahawi said the vaccine would be “voluntary” but added that “the very strong message” is that the jab is “the way we return the whole country to normal”.

6. Trump’s Covid adviser quits after four months
Donald Trump’s controversial special adviser on the coronavirus, Dr Scott Atlas, has resigned. During his four months in the role, Atlas questioned the need for lockdowns, masks and other safety measures. Announcing he would step down, he said the US president had “always relied on the latest science and evidence without any political consideration or influence”.

7. Star says Crown has ‘responsibility’ to state it’s drama
Helena Bonham Carter says The Crown has a “moral responsibility” to tell viewers that it is a drama, rather than historical fact. Following clamour for a “health warning” for people watching the series, the actress, who plays Princess Margaret, said there is an important distinction between “our version”, and the “real version” of royal history.

8. Secret dossier gives ‘granular’ detail on Covid impact
The government has assembled a secret file detailing the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, with a dozen sectors rated “red” and facing significant job cuts and revenue losses. The Times says it gives “granular” detail on the effect of coronavirus on nearly 40 areas of the economy. Separately, ministers have published an assessment of the health, social and economic impacts of coronavirus.

9. Bitcoin reaches new high as ‘wild year’ concludes
The cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged by 9% to a new all-time high of about $19,860 on Monday, topping the previous peak of $19,783 from December 2017. It has risen by more than 175% since the end of 2019 in what CNN describes as a “wild year”. However, in March prices plunged below $4,000 as markets around the globe sank due to the Covid-19 economic crisis.

10. Rita Ora offers to pay fine after party broke lockdown rules
Pop singer Rita Ora has volunteered to pay a £10,000 fine after breaking English lockdown rules to celebrate her 30th birthday. It is reported that up to 30 people attended a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday. “Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility,” she wrote in a statement.

‘Don’t risk a third wave’
“Don’t risk a third wave,” is Metro’s headline as it quotes Dominic Raab’s warning that a third national lockdown cannot be ruled out. The Guardian reports that NHS bosses are planning to enlist the help of “very sensible” celebrities and social media influencers to persuade people to have a Covid vaccine.

The Daily Mirror amplifies retail chiefs’ plea to the public to “Go shop for Britain” as experts say retailers face a £9bn slump in pre-Christmas takings. Non-essential stores in England re-open on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Jeremy Clarkson complains in the i paper that Brexit has “buggered my barley”. The broadcaster says uncertainty over the future of Britain’s relationship with the EU is causing worries for his crop of the cereal.

How the UK could end HIV transmission by 2030
Wider testing ‘could halt new transmissions’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

As coronavirus spread through Britain in the spring, sexual health clinics spoke of a potential opportunity. 

The sudden reduction in new sexual partnerships brought about by lockdown, combined with effective treatments and preventatives, could accelerate us towards the post-HIV era, they said. 

Now there are hopes that some of the lessons learned during the Covid pandemic will speed up the process still further.

How the UK could end HIV transmission by 2030
As the world grapples with the effects of Covid-19, a more protracted battle against a pandemic that has claimed far more lives continues to be fought.

To mark World Aids Day, campaigners are renewing calls for the government to honour an existing commitment to eliminate HIV transmission in the UK by 2030.

Medical science has already made massive headway in tackling the virus. As Deutsche Welle notes, “for most people, an HIV diagnosis in the 1980s was an automatic death sentence”. Four decades later, the NHS says life expectancy averages for HIV-positive patients are “near normal”. But is eradication really in reach?

Covid-19 vaccinations begin on UK’s ‘V-Day’
70 hubs across the UK preparing to give the jab
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

History was made this morning when 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine outside trial conditions.


Keenan said being first was “a privilege” and will return to the hospital in 21 days to receive a booster jab to ensure protection against the virus.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1. Covid-19 vaccinations begin on UK’s ‘V-Day’
At risk patients in the UK will begin receiving the coronavirus jab today, on what has been dubbed “V-Day” by newspapers. About 70 hospital hubs across the UK are preparing to give the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to over-80s, as well as some health and care staff. Among the first to receive the jab wil be Hari and Ranjan Shukla from Newcastle, both in their 80s. Hari said he was “excited” to get the vaccination.

2. Johnson heads to Brussels as negotiations get ‘tricky’
Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for a face-to-face summit with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a final push to break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations. A UK government source said “things are looking very tricky”, while MPs last night voted to reinstate contentious sections of the Internal Markets Bill, overriding sections of the Withdrawal Agreement.

3. Afghan civilians killed by US soar by 330%
The number of Afghan civilians killed in airstrikes carried out by the US and its allies has soared by 330% since 2017, researchers have revealed. The Costs of War Project, based at Brown University, says that in 2019 alone, around 700 civilians were killed. The figure marks the highest number of deaths since the first years of the US invasion after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

4. Government to raise age limit for National Lottery
The age limit for playing the National Lottery will be raised from 16 to 18 from next October. The move is part of the government’s “major and wide-ranging review” of the gambling sector, which could see betting firms face limits on online stakes, restrictions on advertising and a ban on football sponsorship. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the review will tackle “problem gambling in all its forms”.

5. Taxman warns Brexit will create £7.5bn ‘admin burden’
British businesses will face an annual “administrative burden” of £7.5bn after the Brexit transition period, the chief executive of HMRC has warned. Thousands of businesses trading with the EU after the transition period ends on 31 December will be required to fill in customs declarations for the first time. Jim Harra said he expected 265 million declarations in the UK each year, an increase of 211 million.

6. Breakdancing ‘makes mockery’ of Olympic Games
Including breakdancing in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games will make a “mockery” of the event, a sporting legend has warned. Breakdancing will be called “breaking” when competitors take to the floor and was proposed two years ago after trials at the 2018 Youth Olympics. “Yes they’re trying to move with the times but it’s creating a mockery of the thing,” said Australian squash great Michelle Martin.

7. First man to break sound barrier dies at 97
Chuck Yeager, the American test pilot who became the first person to break the sound barrier in 1947, has died at the age of 97. “It is [with] profound sorrow, I must tell you that my life love General Chuck Yeager passed just before 9pm ET,” his wife Victoria said in a tweet. Yeager, who was immortalised through a cameo in The Right Stuff, was widely considered one of America’s greatest ever fighter pilots.

8. Millwall will not ‘take the knee’ at future matches
Millwall FC players will not take a knee before this evening’s fixture against QPR, instead standing arm-in-arm in a “show of solidarity for football’s fight against discrimination”. Millwall’s regular shirt sponsor will also be replaced with the logo of anti-discrimination body Kick It Out. The decision comes after some Millwall fans booed the players taking a knee before Saturday’s defeat by Derby County.

9. Ikea to scrap famous catalogue
Ikea is phasing out its iconic annual catalogue after 70 years. The Swedish retailer said in a statement that it has “taken the emotional but rational decision to respectfully end the successful career” of the print and digital versions of the catalogue. Coming just four months after Argos announced it was scrapping its catalogue, the plan follows an increasing shift to online browsing and shopping.

10. Bob Dylan sells copyright to his back catalogue
Bob Dylan has sold the copyright for his entire back catalogue of music to a global media conglomerate. Although financial terms weren’t revealed for the “landmark agreement” with Universal Music Publishing Group, The New York Times says the deal is estimated to be worth more than $300m (£224.7m). Last week, former Fleetwood Mac songstress Stevie Nicks sold her catalogue in a $100m (£74.9m) deal.

‘Our fightback starts today’
“Our fightback starts today”, the Daily Mirror says, as it splashes on the beginning of Covid-19 vaccinations in the UK. The i says the country will “rejoice” at the jab rollout, while The Guardian predicts that medics may “mix-and-match” coronavirus vaccines in the future.

Several papers lead on Brexit negotiations, with the Daily Mail reporting that “1,629 days after the Brexit vote” we have now reached the “last call for a deal”. With Boris Johnson heading out to meet EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Daily Express predicts a “showdown in Brussels”.

Meanwhile, the Financial Times says Uber has “pulled the plug” on its self-driving car unit, choosing instead to take a stake in rival Aurora.

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Military metaphors may lack subtlety, but they have their uses - and today really does feel like the day we launched the offensive phase of our struggle against the coronavirus.

There are good reasons to be cautious. New coronavirus infections, which had been falling rapidly, seem to have levelled off. Deaths are falling, but slowly. And Christmas could give the virus new ways to spread. 

In other words, we can’t let down our defences yet, and should prepare for retreats as well as advances. But at least now the virus doesn’t hold all the weapons.

A 90-year-old woman has become the the first person in the world to be vaccinated against Covid-19 outside of a clinical trial, as the largest mass vaccination drive in NHS history kicks off on what Health Secretary Matt Hancock has dubbed “V-Day”.

Grandmother-of-four Margaret Keenan received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at 6.31am today at her local hospital in Coventry, after the UK government last week became the first to approve the jab for public use. Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said it was “the best early birthday present I could wish for” .

 “I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year,” she added.

Chance of Brexit deal ‘very slim’ as PM flies to Brussels
Johnson will arrive in Brussels today
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Yesterday’s agreement resolving UK and EU differences on the Irish border, which led the British government to drop its threat to break international law, might have given the impression that a broader deal was imminent.

This morning, both sides are steering reporters away from that conclusion. They say Boris Johnson’s dinner with Ursula von der Leyen this evening really will be make or break.

1. Chance of Brexit deal ‘very slim’ as PM flies to Brussels
Boris Johnson will arrive in Brussels today for post-Brexit trade talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The EU’s chief negotiator has warned the chance of a deal is now “very slim”. If there is no breakthrough at the dinner this evening a no-deal Brexit would be likely. However, Downing Street said that if the discussion goes well, negotiations could resume on Friday.

2. Biden pledges 100m vaccinations in first 100 days
The US president-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in January, has set a target of delivering 100 million Covid vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. “My first 100 days won’t end the Covid-19 virus” he said. “I can't promise that. We did not get into this mess quickly. We're not going to get out of it quickly.” A report has paved the way for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be approved and rolled out for Americans.

4. Mass strike in India over new farming laws
Farmers across India are on strike in a dispute over new agriculture laws, with thousands blocking key roads on the edge of New Delhi. The industrial action follows three rounds of inconclusive talks between the two sides over laws that farmers say are against their interests. The governing Bharatiya Janata Party insists the reforms, which allow private players a greater role in the farming sector, will not harm farmers.

5. Five dead after helicopter crashes in Alps
A helicopter has crashed in the French Alps killing five of the six people on board. The private aircraft was carrying out a rescue mission when it went down near the town of Bonvillard in the Savoie area. Officials say the crash could have been caused by poor weather conditions. France's air accident bureau said that it had opened an investigation.

6. Old Etonians defend sacking of ‘misogynistic’ teacher
Former Eton pupils have supported the school for sacking a teacher they accuse of promoting the idea that “men are violent and women are compliant”. A group of former pupils urged the institution not to reinstate Will Knowland, who was dismissed after refusing to delete a video which set out his rebuff to feminism, sparking a row about free speech. Writing to The Times, they say the decision to sack Knowland was justified by the “intellectually feeble, misogynistic and vitriolic nature” of the video.

7. England rugby ace joins dementia group action
Rugby legend Steve Thompson has been diagnosed with early onset dementia and is joining a group of former players in a potentially landmark legal action for the sport. Thompson, who won the Rugby World Cup with England in 2003, said he cannot remember winning the trophy and would not want his own children to play the game “the way it is at the moment”.

8. Grenfell insulation workers ‘joked about safety’
Employees at the insulation firm behind one of the flammable materials used on Grenfell Tower joked about how their product was not fully tested before being classed as fire safe, an inquiry has heard. Referring to a safety benchmark in instant messages, Arron Chalmers told his colleague Pete Moss that the insulation “doesn't actually get Class 0 when we test the whole product tho LOL!” Moss also described it as a “s**t product”.

9. Two millions British families to be pushed in poverty
Destitution levels in Great Britain are expected to double in the wake of the pandemic, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The study forecasts two million families, including a million children, will struggle to afford to feed themselves, stay warm, or keep clean as the Covid-driven recession deepens. It adds that government polices were driving sharp rises in extreme poverty even before Covid struck.

10. European football tie abandoned after racism storm
Paris St-Germain's game against Istanbul Basaksehir was called off last night when a match official was accused of using a racist term towards one of the away side’s backroom staff. The Turkish club's players protested after their Cameroonian assistant coach Pierre Webo was shown a red card in the 16th minute of the game. Uefa said the game would resume today, adding it “will be conducting a thorough investigation”.

Today’s newspapers
‘One down…54m to go’
“One small jab for Maggie…one giant leap for all of us,” is the Daily Express’s front page headline as it covers the start of the UK’s mass vaccination programme. “One down…54m to go,” is the Daily Mirror’s splash on the same story, but The Daily Telegraph reports a warning that we may have to wear masks for another year.

The Times leads on Boris Johnson’s “last ditch push” for a Brexit deal, quoting one government source as saying “we must be realistic that an agreement may not be possible”. The i newspaper describes today as a “showdown” on the “future of the UK”

Meanwhile, The Guardian reports that England rugby legend Steve Thompson has been diagnosed with early onset dementia and is joining a group of ex-players who are proposing to bring legal action.

Dear Varkeychan,

As Brexit and Covid dominate the headlines yet again, we take a diversion through some of the less well covered stories this evening with The Week Unwrapped podcast.

Our panel considers the future of rugby, an Islamic boycott of French goods and how the technological landscape is changing for the world’s farmers.

Chaos expected as France shuts border
PM will chair a Cobra meeting as lorries back up
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Travel chaos resulting from the closure of French ports is one of the few developments we might have predicted at the beginning of the year, especially if we’d known that a Brexit deal would still be eluding negotiators four days before Christmas.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Chaos expected as France shuts border
Boris Johnson will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee after France closed its border with the UK for 48 hours in response to the fast-spreading new strain of Covid-19. No lorries or ferry passengers will be able to sail from the port of Dover, leading to travel chaos. Manston Airport in Kent is being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 lorries.

2 . Brexit teams miss deadline
Brexit trade talks continue this week after negotiators failed to reach an agreement over the weekend. Negotiators edged closer to a compromise on fishing rights but missed the European Parliament’s deadline. This raises the prospect of weeks without arrangements from 1 January even if an agreement is reached, The Guardian reports.

3 . Retail chiefs beg Sunak for help
Shop bosses are urging the chancellor to extend a business rates holiday amid fears that new coronavirus measures could put thousands of jobs at risk. After non-essential retailers were ordered to shut under new Tier 4 restrictions, industry executives called for help from Rishi Sunak. The Daily Telegraph says the “beleaguered industry” is forecast to suffer a further £2bn of lost sales per week.

4 . Israeli spyware ‘hacked phones’ for UAE
An Israeli private intelligence firm’s spyware was used to hack the phones of dozens of Al Jazeera journalists, claim leading researchers. The experts at the University of Toronto said they discovered what appears to be a major espionage campaign against one of the world’s leading media organisations, ordered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

5 . PM ‘delayed Christmas move to avoid vote’

6 . Boeing 737 cleared by safety regulator
The executive director of Europe's aviation safety agency says he is “certain” Boeing’s 737 Max is now safe to fly. Patrick Ky insisted his organisation had “left no stone unturned” in its review of the jet and its analysis of design changes made by the manufacturer. The aircraft was grounded in March 2019 after two accidents in which a total of 346 people died.

7 . Rise in terror arrests during 2020
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a spike in the number of children being arrested for terrorism, say police. A total of 17 under-18s were arrested in the year to September 2020 compared with 11 in the year to September 2019. Police say the pandemic is promoting a climate for lonely young people to be drawn to terror groups.

8 . India crowns new Miss Transqueen
Fashion designer Shaine Soni has been named India’s Miss Transqueen at the country’s beauty pageant for transgender women. She will represent India at next year’s Miss International Queen, the world’s biggest pageant for transgender women. Soni was born biologically male but she identified as a girl from a young age.

9 . Pandemic helps us sleep longer
The Covid-19 pandemic means people are finally getting the right amount of sleep, according to a British scientist. Analysis from a sleep-tracking app found users had woken up much later on average after March 2020 than they did last year, while their bedtimes did not significantly change. People are staying in bed for around an hour later.

10 . Hamilton named BBC sport personality
Lewis Hamilton has been voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2020. The Formula 1 world champion equalled Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles with his fourth consecutive championship in 2020. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson finished second in the public vote while jockey Hollie Doyle came in third. “I want to say congratulations to all the incredible nominees,” said Hamilton.

Today’s newspapers
‘Britain is sick man of Europe’
Britain has become the “sick man of Europe,” the Daily Mirror says, as countries shut off travel connections with the UK. The Times says Europe has “shut the door” and The Sun says the French government has shown “no merci” over its decision to ban all travel from Britain.

The Daily Mail says we are set for “the worst noël” with “agony set to last months” after Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that Tier 4 restrictions could be in place for some time.

The science behind delaying the second dose
Two doses of the Covid vaccine ‘essential’ - but timing may not be
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

While Britain has relatively low rates of vaccine scepticism - certainly compared with France -  the government is anxious not to undermine that confidence.

It will be reassured, then, to hear that several other countries are now also planning to increase the gap between doses of the Covid vaccine, which will allow more people to be protected more quickly.

vaccine strategy
The science behind delaying the second dose
Governments and health experts worldwide are considering whether to follow the UK in inoculating as many people as possible against Covid by giving them each just one dose rather than two.

The debate has been raging since the end of December, when Boris Johnson’s government announced plans to postpone giving the second dose of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines by up to 12 weeks.  

Denmark has now unveiled plans to delay the second dose of both the Pfizer and forthcoming Moderna jabs by up to six weeks, and Germany is considering a similar move.

But newly published data from the Office of National Statistics that suggests one in 50 people in England are currently infected with the coronavirus has prompted many of the rebels to think again.

Varkeychan, your recap of all stories published this week at The Ken India‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌
Good Morning Varkeychan,
 
What a week it has been for cricket fans. Even if you’re not a fan of the sport, I’m willing to wager that you set aside some time on Tuesday to celebrate a hard-fought Indian victory Down Under. I know I did, but then, I’m a cricket fan(atic).
 
Let's sidestep the ‘Lessons for leaders from India’s victory’, it’s all over social media anyway. Instead, let me draw your attention to the parallels drawn by ESPNCricinfo’s senior editor Sharda Ugra between the regenerative ability of many creatures in the natural world and the Indian cricket team’s regeneration during this tour. Much like them, some of the stories that our writers at The Ken took on this week also had a regenerative tinge to it.
 
Take Bhumika’s story that we kicked off the week with. The hotels, restaurants, and catering (HoReCa) space was left reeling by the pandemic. Earlier projections of the industry being worth $754 billion by 2022 now seemed far-fetched. To survive, the B2B food sector shifted lanes to B2C. Some companies are finding their path, but others’ futures are still hanging in the balance. It’s a fascinating read.
 
On Wednesday, Olina wrote about the accountability crisis brewing behind the scenes of one of India’s oldest business schools, the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). So much so that it has impacted IIM-C’s annual spend on research—it went from $81,000 to $9,500, something that should set alarm bells ringing.  
 
As one of the IIM-C faculty members said, “If you had the same budget, would you now choose IIM-C over NUS in Singapore? I don’t think so.” Unless it can regenerate itself, of course. IIM-C is also our CEO Rohin’s alma mater; maybe you should write to him or tweet at him and ask how he feels about all this.
 
Just like India’s victory resulted from a fabulous team effort, we had great collaborative and cross-country stories this week.
 
On Tuesday, Seetharaman teamed up with our illustrator Sharath and contributor Sunny Sabharwal to break down foodtech giant Zomato’s financial game. The company’s food delivery business (B2C), like similar businesses globally, saw its fortunes swing upwards after an initial hiccup. But as it prepares itself for an IPO, has it done enough regeneration of its businesses to get the investors to salivate?
 
You know how stay-at-home orders last year meant that we turned to the safety of our mobile screens to keep us connected and entertained? So, on Thursday, Jum from the Philippines, Jon from Thailand, and our designer Prajakta from India decided to piece together the little numbers caught in between the big picture in Southeast Asia’s mobile app scene. If you didn’t know that people in SEA collectively spent an amount of time that roughly equalled 110,350 years just binging content on video streaming apps, then you’re in for a treat.
 
We capped off the week with a free story when three of our stellar reporters—Pratap, Maitri, and Olina—put their brains together to find out what’s happening with India’s vaccination drive against Covid-19. It’s not about the cold chain or the logistics to inoculate its 1.3 billion citizens, but about the app at the centre of it all. CoWIN has been glitchy, unpredictable, and it is also sparking serious privacy concerns. It’s supposed to be like the axe in Abraham Lincoln’s famous quote, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” Except that CoWIN is still blunt.  
 
Before I let you go, here’s another wonderful cricket story by Mukul Kesavan, featuring the butterfly in Brisbane. If you watched the game, you’ll know what I’m referring to. If not, read it and find out. And then take another moment to relive the victory. That final drive down the ground is likely to remain etched in my memory for a long time, the same way that six that sealed the World Cup win a decade ago has remained.
 
I’m going to indulge myself with the highlights from these matches again today. I hope you enjoy the rest of your Sunday too.
 
Cheers,

What the Novavax results mean for the UK
Approval would leave UK with millions of excess doses
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After Tuesday’s bleak news about the UK death toll, we end the week with a flurry of encouraging developments.

Two more vaccines proved themselves effective against Covid - one of them after a single dose. The other needs two doses, but is the first to prove that it works against the Kent variant of the virus.

In the short term, though, the most positive news of all may be “very promising” data about the 7.9 million UK residents who have already received the vaccine.

What the Novavax results mean for the UK
Britain’s Covid vaccines rollout is on course to get a fresh boost after a new jab was found to be 89.3% effective in large-scale UK trials.

The UK has already secured 60 million doses of the Novavax vaccine, which will now be assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and could be “delivered in the second half of this year” if approved, the BBC reports.

Stan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK phase three trial were “spectacular” and “as good as we could have hoped”.

Small-time investors are now targeting silver
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Hedge fund managers are flocking to “foul-mouthed online message boards” to inform their investment strategies, according to the Financial Times - perhaps a little testy after being jilted by its own natural audience.

The latest target for the online activists is silver, which has been pushed to an eight-year high. Unlike last week’s efforts to rally around a games retailer, this sudden surge of interest in precious metals could have real-world consequences.

all that glisters
The price of silver has hit a five-month high as the online trading war between Reddit users and Wall Street hedge funds spills over into the precious metals market.  

Last week, shares in struggling US video-games retailer GameStop skyrocketed after Reddit forum WallStreetBets took on huge hedge funds that were betting against the stock. The war between short sellers and the band of private investors has seen GameStop’s share price jump by 1,700% in the space of a month. 

Now, small-time investors on WallStreetBets are teaming up to pump their money in silver, in what appears to be a fresh bid “to hurt big banks they believe are artificially suppressing prices”, says CNN.

Have the UK and EU avoided a vaccine war?
So what happened on Friday evening? Political pundits are still scratching their heads after the EU was and then wasn’t set to control Covid vaccine exports to Ireland, before describing any threat to do so an “oversight”.

Although the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products, Article 16 of the deal acts as a get-out clause if the protocol could lead to serious “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.

Never mind how hard those in their sixties, seventies or eighties worked for their comforts, they are routinely held as responsible for twentysomethings’ housing woes, stagnating wages and environmental concerns - as though they were part of a conscious gerontocratic conspiracy to short-change young people.”

Rishi Sunak says experts ‘moving goalposts’ on lockdown
Chancellor believes UK approach point of lifting lockdown for good
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Chris Whitty last night told the daily press briefing that the UK is “past the peak” of the latest Covid wave. But those waiting for a hasty end to lockdown shouldn’t hold their breath.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak is growing increasingly concerned that the experts are using lockdowns to “keep cases down overall”, rather than to protect the most vulnerable, allies say.

However, with Whitty also warning that “another peak” is possible, those aims may not be totally distinct from one another.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Sunak says experts ‘moving goalposts’

2 . UK trials mixing vaccines
The UK is launching a study to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for their first and second doses works as well - or better than - the current approach of using the same jab twice. Scientists have pointed out that Ebola immunisation programmes involve mixing different jabs to enhance protection. The Com-Cov study, run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium, will involve more than 800 volunteers over the age of 50 in England. Those not involved in the trial will continue to receive the same vaccine at both appointments.

3 . US ‘disturbed’ by Uighur report

4 . World’s first double transplant
Doctors in New York have completed the world’s first successful face and double hand transplant. Joe DiMeo, 22, from New Jersey, underwent a 23-hour surgery after suffering third-degree burns over 80% of his body in a car accident. A medical team of more than 140 experts transplanted a full face, as well as amputating both of DiMeo’s hands and replacing them mid-forearm. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime gift, and I hope the family can take some comfort knowing that part of the donor lives on with me”, DiMeo said.

5 . UN calls on leaders to act against coup
The UN secretary general has pledged to rally enough international pressure on Myanmar’s military “to make sure that this coup fails”. António Guterres described the reversal of elections as “unacceptable”, adding that he would call on “key actors and [the] international community” to stop the snatching of power. The UN Security Council is discussing a possible statement, however, China is expected to block any wording that condemns the coup.

6 . Johnson to tax meat and cheese
Consumers could face paying higher prices for meat, cheese and gas heating under plans being drawn up for new carbon taxes and charges. Boris Johnson has ordered every Whitehall department to produce a “price” for carbon emissions across all areas of the economy. The carbon reduction blueprint is expected to be announced in the run-up to Cop26, the UN climate change conference being hosted in Glasgow in November.

7 . Coughing Covid a ‘greater risk than thought’
Covid patients’ coughing puts NHS frontline staff in more danger than previously thought, a study has found. The research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that coughing generated at least 10 times more infectious “aerosol” particles than speaking or breathing. The news has led to fresh demands that those caring for Covid patients should be provided with PPE that stops even the smallest virus-carrying droplets. The study also suggests that hospital ventilation should be improved.

8 . Beckham-backed cannabis venture floats
A company that uses compounds found in cannabis to make skincare and athletic products plans to float on the London Stock Exchange. Cellular Goods is part of a growing market for products that use chemicals found in cannabis for skin regimes and has sold a minority stake to DB Ventures, David Beckham’s investment firm. The former Manchester United and England star “is understood to believe that the use of CBD in consumer goods is an attractive growth prospect for his investment portfolio”, Sky News says.

9 . ‘Pathetic’ Whitty heckler condemned

10 . Olympics chief said women talk too much
The head of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics organising committee has conceded that he may have to resign after making sexist remarks about “talkative” female sports officials. Yoshiro Mori, a former Japanese prime minister with a history of colourful remarks, told a meeting of the Japanese Olympic Committee that meetings attended by too many women tended to “drag on” because they talked too much.

The restrictions that could be lifted by May
Outdoor socialising may be allowed within weeks
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Today’s newspaper front pages are the most optimistic we’ve seen since the discovery of the Kent coronavirus variant before Christmas.

While there’s little doubt that vaccines are changing the rules of the game, it may be a sign of our diminished expectations that the idea of outdoor dining at the end of March is generating quite such enthusiasm.

hope springs eternal
The restrictions lined up to be lifted by May
The lockdown in England will begin to lift within weeks under “tentative” plans being drawn up by ministers hoping for a “quick return to normal” in the wake of the vaccines rollout, according to reports.

Government sources have told The Times that outdoor socialising and sports will be the first activities to get the green light from Boris Johnson after children return to school in March. 

Open-air markets and al-fresco dining are also expected to to be allowed to resume at around the same time, “but high-street shops and indoor dining will have to wait”, says the Daily Mail.

What the South African study means for the UK
Modified version of Oxford jab is in development
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

While it may be a setback for South Africa, the Oxford vaccine’s reduced effectiveness against that country’s dominant variant of Covid is not an immediate threat to the UK immunisation programme.

The South African strain remains rare here, with only 146 reported cases so far. 

But this time last year we had seen only four cases of coronavirus in total. Ministers will want to be sure that the new variant doesn’t follow the same trajectory as its predecessors.

What the South African study means for the UK
The rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to healthcare workers in South Africa has been paused after a new study raised doubts about the efficacy of the jab against the country’s most common form of the virus. 

Experts and ministers in the UK have been quick to point of the limited nature of the research and the limited spread of the South African variant here.

And with social media encouraging people to “reach the ‘correct’ take” on any given issue first, “you can see why people think fatalism is a good stance to pick”. But “hope is good for us”, and “pandemics do end”, she continues. “Whatever some people have taken to saying lately, better days are on the horizon.”

Will the Sturgeon-Salmond split sink the SNP?
Dispute ‘could bring down Scotland’s first minister’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Supporters of the SNP often accuse the English media of ignoring matters north of the border, but they may be grateful that relatively few column inches have been devoted to their party’s present strife.

The three-year dispute resolves around Nicola Sturgeon’s handling of sexual abuse allegations against her predecessor, Alex Salmond. Since his acquittal, the latter has hinted that he has information which will damage the woman who succeeded him as first minister.

Will the Sturgeon-Salmond split sink the SNP?
Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond have dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade, leading the campaign for independence during the 2014 referendum - and dealing with the fallout of their defeat.

But allegations of sexual harassment against Salmond have driven a wedge between the leading lights of the “out” campaign, with some suggesting that the dispute “could force Sturgeon to quit as first minister”, the BBC reports.

And while “the truth may never be excavated from beneath the rubble of civil war between nationalist factions”, writes The Guardian’s Rafael Behr, the divisions exposed in the independence movement could dent Sturgeon’s hopes of throwing off Westminster’s influence north of the border.

World vaccine leader begins staged exit from lockdown

Dear Varkeychan,

Vaccinations are continuing apace, infections are falling quickly and deaths aren’t far behind - and yet the ministerial mood music has rarely been more downbeat.

Since we’ll have to wait another fortnight until the government even talks about how lockdown might end, it’s worth casting an eye at Israel. British ministers have reportedly been following developments there closely...

What Israel may tell us about the UK roadmap
While vaccine nationalism has left many countries at loggerheads during the Covid pandemic, relations between Israel and the UK appear to have been given a booster shot by the jabs rollout race.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been in regular contact with his Israeli counterpart, Yuli Edelstein, with the pair reportedly sharing tips to put in place speedy national immunisation campaigns.

And with a tentative lifting of Israel’s third lockdown now beginning, the allied nation’s plan may offer an insight into what to expect when Boris Johnson lay out the UK’s roadmap to normality later this month.

Boris Johnson unveils ‘road to freedom’
PM reveals four-step plan to end England’s lockdown
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After Boris Johnson last night laid out his plan for ending the UK’s third lockdown, the country now has its first tantalising glimpse of a return to normal.

Assuming the vaccine campaign continues at pace and hospitalisations are kept to manageable levels, 21 June will be the date on which all legal limits on social contact end.

The date will mark 455 days since the prime minister announced the first lockdown in March 2020, 14 months that have changed the country forever.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . PM unveils ‘road to freedom’
Boris Johnson last night said that his four-step plan to ease England’s lockdown is a “one-way road to freedom”. The prime minister promised spring and summer would be “incomparably better” as he paved the way for nightclubs to reopen, sports fans to fill stadiums and domestic tourism to return. He also revealed that “Covid status certificates” are being considered to help businesses reopen.

2 . Covid infections rise again
Britain recorded 10,641 Covid infections yesterday in the first week-on-week rise since the beginning of January. Official data shows that Covid cases were 9% up on last Monday, when 9,765 infections were reported. Boris Johnson yesterday told MPs that his plan to end lockdown is “cautious but irreversible”, adding that there is “no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world”.

3 . Iran in uranium threat

4 . Trump loses tax battle
The US supreme court has declined to intervene to halt the turnover of Donald Trump’s tax records to a prosecutor in New York City. The court’s action was a victory for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, who has been seeking Trump’s tax records since 2019. The former president claimed that the legal battle was part of “the continuing political persecution of President Donald J. Trump”. His accountants must now turn over eight years of tax documents to investigators.

5 . Drug lord’s wife arrested in US
The wife of Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán has been arrested in the US on suspicion of drug trafficking. Emma Coronel Aispuro, who was detained at Washington Dulles International Airport, is charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana. Guzmán, a former head of the international Sinaloa cartel, is serving a life sentence for drug trafficking and money laundering.

6 . Facebook restores Australian news

7 . Salmond slams ‘malicious’ plot
Alex Salmond has claimed there was a “malicious and concerted” attempt to remove him from public life following allegations of sexual harassment against him in 2018. In his submission to a Scottish parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the allegations against him, the former first minister also said that the husband and chief of staff of his former ally and successor, Nicola Sturgeon, are among those trying to take him down. Sturgeon has challenged Salmond to prove there was a conspiracy against him, saying he has made claims “without a shred of evidence”.

8 . Biden marks Covid milestone
Joe Biden yesterday urged the country to unite in its battle against Covid-19 as the nation’s death toll from the virus passed 500,000. “I ask all Americans to remember those we lost and those we left behind,” the president said. “But as we all remember, I also ask us to act, to remain vigilant, to stay socially distanced, to mask up, get vaccinated when it’s your turn.” More than 28.1 million Americans have so far been infected - another global record.

9 . Furlough ‘to continue till May’
Boris Johnson has signalled that the furlough scheme will continue beyond next month as he pledged not to “pull the rug out” while lockdown restrictions are being eased. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to extend the support scheme until at least May, with sources suggesting that furlough support will be gradually wound down after that month. Meanwhile, trade unions are demanding that the furlough scheme be extended until the end of the year.

10 . Uber ‘deterring drivers’ on cash
Lawyers have accused Uber of trying to deter drivers from seeking compensation for missed holiday and minimum wage payments after last week’s court ruling. The taxi-hailing app may have to pay out more than £100m after the UK Supreme Court ruled that drivers must be classified as workers. However, it has written to drivers claiming “this judgment does not apply to drivers who earn on the app today”. Lawyers acting for the drivers believe they are due about £12,000 in compensation each, which would cost Uber more than £26m.

Today’s newspapers
‘The wait escape’
“The wait escape” is The Sun’s headline after Boris Johnson’s last night revealed his cautious plan to end the UK’s third lockdown. Metro says the prime minister has announced that 21 June is the “day life goes back to normal”, while the Daily Mirror says that the milestones along the way will be the “best days of our lives”.

Amid the celebrations, The Guardian reports that the PM also warned that lifting lockdown will “inevitably result in more cases, hospitalisations and deaths”. The Daily Mail, meanwhile, wonders why “it’s going to take months” for the restrictions to be eased given falling infection rates.

In other news, the Daily Star devotes part of its splash to the claim that flared trousers are coming back into fashion. “Haven’t we suffered enough?”, the paper asks.

Flu cases drop to zero as lockdown cuts infection
But experts fear epidemic next winter
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

While social distancing and vaccines are steadily driving down Covid cases - today the seven-day average of new cases fell below 10,000 for the first time in five months - their effect on flu has been even more dramatic.

Yet it seems that every silver lining has a dark cloud. Health officials are expecting an unusually virulent flu season next year - on top of the negative health effects of battling the pandemic.

Flu cases drop to zero as lockdown cuts infection
Not a single case of influenza have been recorded in England for the past seven weeks - but the country may pay for the lull with more severe outbreaks next winter, scientists are warning. 

Public Health England flu expert Dr Vanessa Saliba told The Independent that the current record-low flu infection rates are “likely due to changes in our behaviour, such as social distancing, face coverings and hand washing, as well as the reduction in international travel” during the Covid-19 pandemic.

She also credited increased uptake in the flu vaccine, saying this season’s immunisation programme is on track to be “the most successful ever”.But experts fear drop in immunity may pave way for major influenza epidemic next winter

Covid response ‘exacerbated other diseases’

We are living through an age of untold suffering. Over 500,000 people have died from coronavirus in the US alone, over 120,000 in the UK, and over two million worldwide. With Covid-19 dominating the news cycle, you would be forgiven for forgetting that other diseases still exist. And yet we know full well that diseases don’t stop just because one is hogging all the limelight.

‘The grotesque sight of Labour united with right-wing Tory rebels’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

“If the rumours are correct and we end up with the grotesque sight of Labour whipped into voting alongside right-wing Tory rebels to defeat a meagre corporation tax rise that would only affect those who’ve done well out of the pandemic, then I fear for the future,” says Ian Lavery on HuffPost. Our country “depends on Labour to argue for, and point the way to, a better future,” he argues. And this future “must be built on a partnership with society, paid for by taxation – not a partnership with business, paid for by society”.

Millions of Brits living in ‘Covid free’ areas
Hundreds of neighbourhoods recorded close to zero cases last week
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After data yesterday revealed that one vaccine dose cuts the risk of hospitalisation among high-risk groups by more than 80%, this morning brings more good news.

Over seven million people in the UK are living in areas that reported fewer than three new Covid cases last week.

The dramatic drop in infections offers a glimpse into the impact of the vaccine campaign, as well as boosting hopes that Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown is on track.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Millions live in ‘Covid free’ areas
More than seven million people in the UK are living in areas where cases of Covid-19 have become negligible, according to The Telegraph. Analysis of official data has found that hundreds of neighbourhoods across the country recorded close to zero cases last week. The areas include large parts of Cornwall, Devon and Wiltshire. Others in London include Notting Hill West, while Trafford in Manchester also recorded almost no new infections.

2 . Sunak to boost culture and sport
Rishi Sunak is expected to announce more than £400m of additional support for the badly-hit culture sector in tomorrow’s Spring Budget. The chancellor will hand out £408m to help museums, theatres and galleries in England reopen once Covid restrictions start to ease. Sunak is also planning a £300m sports recovery package, with a “significant chunk” allocated to cricket.

3 . Genocide warning in Ethiopia
The ousted leader of Ethiopia’s Tigray region has accused the federal government and its Eritrean allies of genocide. Speaking to CNN, the President of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front Debretsion Gebremichael called for an independent probe into the alleged killings, rape and violence. He said US President Joe Biden must ramp up the pressure against “invader forces”.

4 . Johnson accused of secret fund

5 . Nigerian girls released
A group of girls who were abducted from a boarding school in Nigeria have been released and are “safe”, according to reports. Armed men shouting slogans including “Allahu akbar” and “God is great” abducted 317 students from the Girls Science Secondary School in Zamfara state on Friday. Sky News says that several large groups of armed men operate in the region and are known to kidnap for money and for the release of their members from jail. The government has repeatedly denied paying ransoms for the return of the girls.

6 . US warned of fourth Covid wave

7 . Prince Philip moves hospital
The Duke of Edinburgh was yesterday transferred to St Bartholomew’s Hospital for continued treatment. Prince Philip, 99, had already spent 13 nights at another London hospital and is being treated for an infection. Doctors will also carry out testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition. Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip is responding to treatment and “remains comfortable”.

8 . Sarkozy to appeal sentence
Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, has been sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended, after a high-profile corruption investigation. Sarkozy was convicted of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 by suggesting he could secure a plush job for him in return for information about a separate case. The 66-year-old’s lawyer says he will appeal the sentence and Sarkozy will remain free during that process.

9 . Jabs cut hospital risk by 80%
A single shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or the Pfizer-BioNTech jab reduces the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%, the BBC reports. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the daily press briefing yesterday that the latest vaccine results were “very strong”, adding that data on falling infections is “seriously encouraging”. Government scientists hailed the results, but added that two doses were still needed for the best protection.

10 . Phone addiction impacts sleep
Almost 40% of university students are so addicted to their smartphones that they suffer from bad sleep, according to new research. A study of 1,043 students aged 18 to 30 at King’s College London found that 406 had symptoms of smartphone addiction and more than two-thirds of the addicts had trouble sleeping, compared with 57.1% of those who were not addicted to their device. The youngest participants in the study were the most likely to show signs of addiction.

Today’s newspapers
‘Prayers for Philip’
The Daily Mirror this morning calls for “Prayers for Philip” after the Duke of Edinburgh was moved to a specialist hospital for tests on a pre-existing heart condition. Prince Philip, 99, is now at London’s St Bartholomew’s and is also battling an infection.

The Daily Mail splashes on allegations that Boris Johnson is secretly trying to set up a charity to help pay for a costly makeover of his Downing Street flat. The paper says the scheme could cause claims of a “conflict of interest” if it is bankrolled by Tory donors.

And the Financial Times says Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use tomorrow’s budget to launch new rules aimed at helping the City of London attract fast-growing companies to compete with financial centres including New York, Amsterdam and Frankfurt.

Has the US ever had Covid under control?
Scientists warn of ‘fourth surge of cases’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

On paper, the US has been hit less hard by Covid than the worst-affected countries in Europe - including the UK - where death rates have been higher. 

But the ebb and flow of the pandemic has been quite different. Whereas we have had two distinct waves of infections followed by a sharp drop, the US has had a rolling series of shallow peaks and troughs as outbreaks move from state to state. And in the past week, case numbers have been rising rather than falling.

fourth wave fear
Has the US ever had Covid under control?
During the early days of the pandemic, the response from Donald Trump’s White House was focused more on shutting down any sense of panic than locking down to avoid infections.

Trump repeatedly suggested that the virus was “going to disappear”, a prediction that unsurprisingly did not materialise before he was ejected from office in last year’s election.

Under Joe Biden, the publication of a 200-page Covid-19 strategy document in late January suggested a change of management style. But with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warning of the threats of new variants, it remains to be seen whether the new president can wrest control of the coronavirus.

Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. Rishi Sunak’s love of the Star Wars films is well documented, but “it is not yet clear what kind of new world order the Treasury crusader wants to create”, writes Rachael Sylvester in The Times. As Sunak prepares to unveil his budget tomorrow, the unanswered question of his “long-term political mission” looms ever larger. Because after all, “chancellors are not just accountants; they have the power to reshape the country”, says Sylvester. Describing a dinner party where she was seated next to him, she recalls that “we started talking about knife crime - my teenage son had just been mugged at knifepoint - and I realised I had no idea where he stood on law and order”.

Why the Irish border is back on the agenda
EU threatens legal action over UK plan to delay parts of Brexit deal
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Having got Brexit done in the nick of time, the British government now seems to be trying to undo at least one bit if it - with the inadvertent assistance of the EU.

It was the European side that broke first, briefly suspending the Northern Ireland Protocol when it feared that Covid vaccines might be exported across the Irish border. Now the UK says it won’t be ready to bring in the stricter rules required from the end of this month.

While the Irish government has called for pragmatism, the EU is sticking to the letter of the law - and Boris Johnson seems less keen on a deal he hailed as a triumph just a couple of months ago.

Why the Irish border is back on the agenda
Just two months after the signing of a Brexit trade deal, the issue of the Irish border has re-emerged as a serious sticking point between the UK and EU.

Brussels has warned that it will launch legal action “very soon” after the UK government on Wednesday announced that it would delay the implementation of parts of the Brexit deal to allow businesses in Northern Ireland time to adapt.

Cabinet Office minister David Frost said that the UK would extend “grace periods” to ease trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. However, the plan provoked a “furious response” in Brussels, The Guardian reports.

‘Brexit allows us to be immigration liberals’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “Not so long ago, immigration was the issue that troubled Brits the most,” writes James Forsyth in The Times. But today, just 2 per cent of voters say it is the country’s most pressing issue. Maybe it’s the “Covid effect” or perhaps “the end of free movement and the resumption of border control has taken much of the heat out of the issue”, he says. But the country’s dramatic shift in attitude can be seen in the “remarkably uncontroversial” policy towards offering visas to Hong Kongers following China’s National Security Law. “Something has changed utterly” and it is now up to Boris Johnson to deliver a “more sensible policy, to make this a country that seeks out talent from around the world”.

What next for the royals after ‘racism’ allegations?

Dear Varkeychan,

The traditional royal response to any kind of unwelcome reporting, however trivial or lurid, was never to complain and never to explain.

Last week’s leak of bullying allegations made against the Duchess of Sussex two years ago suggests “The Firm” is planning a more proactive approach - although it remains to be seen what form it will take.

The Royal Family is facing an unprecedented PR disaster as racism allegations made by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle threaten to tarnish the Crown’s reputation across the world.

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired in the US last night, the couple claimed that a member of the family raised “concerns” about “how dark” the colour of their son Archie’s skin would be when he was born. 

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex declined to name the family member. But the allegations of racism within “The Firm” are dominating headlines and reportedly sent shockwaves through Buckingham Palace.

‘Equality seemed simple, so we underestimated how revolutionary such changes would be’

Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

On International Women’s Day, we “look back in anger - but with pride, too”, writes Polly Toynbee in The Guardian. The passing of the Equal Pay and Sex Discrimination Acts in the 70s did not represent “liberation won”, but one step towards changing cultural norms. “Equality seemed simple, so we underestimated how revolutionary such changes would be,” Toynbee writes. Today, women still face widespread discrimination at work or in the home, and the pandemic has affected women particularly badly. So, “Are we nearly there yet? No, but we’ve come quite a way. That, at least, signals hope.”

Media rejects Prince Harry racism claim
Couple criticised for attacking press without supporting evidence
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s war with the British press looks set to rumble on after the airing of their tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey on ITV last night.

After the Duke said press “racism” was behind the pair’s decision to leave the UK, the Society of Editors said tabloid media is “not bigoted and will not be swayed from its vital role holding the rich and powerful to account”.

The Sussex’s request for privacy, it seems, may not be forthcoming just yet.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Media reject Prince Harry racism claim
The Society of Editors has denied the media is racist after Prince Harry said racism from within the tabloid press was a “large part” of why he and Meghan Markle left the UK. In the couple’s tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey, broadcast on ITV last night, the Duke alleged that the tabloid media in the UK is “bigoted” and creates a “toxic environment”. However, the media freedom organisation criticised the couple for accusing the press of racism without “any supporting evidence”.

2 . Report declares Xinjiang ‘genocide’
China’s actions in Xinjiang have violated every single provision in the United Nations’ Genocide Convention, according to an independent report by dozens of global experts. The report, published by the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy think tank, alleges that the Chinese government “bears state responsibility for an on-going genocide against the Uyghur in breach of the (UN) Genocide Convention”. The report was put together by a host of global figures in human rights, war crimes and international law. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said allegations of a genocide “couldn’t be more preposterous”.

3 . UK economy changed forever
The economy will never fully return to its pre-pandemic pattern even as life slowly returns to normal, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Andrew Bailey said that shifts in spending and working patterns seen over the past 12 months would prove permanent. He continued that the structural economic changes during the crisis will not end, but “my best guess is that we will see some persistence, not full persistence but not a full reversion to pre-Covid either”.

4 . Biden offers Taliban power-share
Joe Biden has offered the Taliban a return to power in Afghanistan as he seeks to bring the longest war in American history to an end. The White House is ready to offer the Islamic fundamentalists a power-sharing deal with the Afghan government if they agree to lay down their arms. The offer comes almost two decades after the US invasion that “routed the Taliban regime and triggered a bloody insurgency that has killed tens of thousands of people”, The Times says.

5 . UK could have fourth wave
England’s deputy chief medical adviser has warned that it is too soon to rule out a fourth wave of Covid-19. Jenny Harries told the daily press briefing that under current levels of infection, “a new wave could easily take off again”. Her call for caution came as Boris Johnson admitted that with the re-opening of schools “there will be a risk of increased transmission” that could delay the end of lockdown. The UK yesterday reported less than 100 deaths for the second day in a row, the first time that has happened since 9 October.

6 . Brazil’s Lula cleared in court
Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been cleared of corruption by a Supreme Court judge. Lula was freed in 2019 after 18 months in jail following a major bribery scandal involving politicians and business leaders. The development paves the way for the 75-year-old to make a run for the presidency in 2022. However, the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, has accused the Supreme Court judge of bias. The annulment was celebrated by leftist figures, including Argentinian President Alberto Fernandez who said the convictions were “issued with the sole purpose of persecution and eliminating him from politics”.

7 . Call for action on conversions
Campaigners have warned that ministers are not moving quickly enough to ban LGBT+ “conversion therapy”. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch insisted that the government is “committed” to “ending” the practice and takes the issue “very seriously”. But equality campaigners said targeted action is required. Conversion therapy refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy that aims to change a person’s sexual orientation, “ranging from electric shock treatment to religious teaching and discussion”, the BBC reports.

8 . Nightingales to close
The NHS has announced that the emergency Nightingale hospitals set up to cope with a surge of Covid-19 cases are to close from April. Seven Nightingale hospitals were built in England, beginning in April 2020 with the 4,000-bed facility at London’s ExCel centre. Birmingham, Bristol, Belfast, Cardiff, Exeter, Sunderland, Harrogate, Glasgow and Manchester also had their own temporary hospitals. The sites in London and Sunderland will stay open for vaccinations.

9 . Loophole closed on sex abuse
Sports coaches and priests who have sex with 16- and 17-year-olds in their care are to face prosecution after the government closes a contentious legal loophole. A new law will prevent adults in positions of trust from engaging in sexual relationships with young people under 18. It will bring sports coaches and religious leaders into line with the legislation currently in place for teachers and doctors.

10 . Ex-soldier killed fiancée
An inquest has heard that a former soldier, who was granted bail after threatening his fiancée with a gun, killed her in a frenzied attack just weeks later. Terence Papworth, who served in Afghanistan, used a vodka bottle and ornamental sword in the “sustained” attack on Amy-Leanne Stringfellow. Doncaster Coroner’s Court heard a post-mortem examination found 58 different injuries. Papworth was found dead in Leeds Prison in November.

How the world responded to Harry and Meghan
Even Joe Biden appears to have tuned in

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

While most British newspapers have either sided with the remaining royals - or else reserved judgement - the international press has come out decisively for Team Harry and Meghan.

But the biggest beneficiary, most commentators agree, will be the queen of the television interview, Oprah Winfrey herself.

How the world responded to Harry and Meghan
Headlines across the globe are being dominated by allegations of racism within the Royal Family following the broadcast of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey.

As “The Firm” considers its next move - with the Queen reportedly vetoing a prepared statement last night - the world’s media are filling the vacuum left by their silence over what The Times’ Carol Midgley describes as a “televised napalm raid” on the Palace.

The “hysterical” reaction of “Britain's notorious tabloid press” is especially hard to miss, with “wall-to-wall coverage” from commentators who are “apoplectic with rage” after the interview aired on ITV on Monday, says The Hollywood Reporter.

‘You can’t calm the tabloid sharks by throwing steaks at them’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

Yesterday’s airing of Oprah Winfrey’s interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle prompted a “news meltdown” among the UK press, writes Hugo Rifkind in The Times. It was an unsurprising reaction given that “royalty is Britain’s oldest soap opera”. And while it is hard not to sympathise with the “daily, grinding attention” to which Markle was subjected, it is puzzling that the royal couple saw this interview as “the way out”. “You don’t calm the sharks by throwing steaks at them”, he adds. The Royal media machine will “never calm down”, and the couple’s interview fed its “insatiable” appetite.

Brazil’s Covid ‘atom bomb’ could go worldwide
Country could be a ‘breeding ground’ for new variants

Dear Varkeychan,

In most of the world, the coronavirus pandemic is stable or in retreat. Not so in Brazil, though, where health officials say the threat to local residents - and to the rest of the world - has been underplayed.

The risk, they warn, is that all the progress we’ve made in the past year could be undone by a virulent, vaccine-evading mutation

Brazil’s Covid ‘atom bomb’ could go worldwide
Brazil’s largest cities are facing the collapse of their health systems, experts have warned, after the country yesterday reported 1,972 Covid deaths - a new daily record.

Fiocruz, Brazil’s health institute, has warned that more than 80% of intensive care beds are occupied in 25 of the country’s 27 state capitals, amid fears that “the highly contagious variant in Brazil may have knock-on effects in the region and beyond”, the BBC reports.

“Brazil is a threat to humanity”, Fiocruz epidemiologist Jesem Orellana told the Agence France-Presse news agency. “The best we can do is hope for the miracle of mass vaccination or a radical change in the management of the pandemic.”

Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “Whether you consider the duchess is a victim of racism or believe that she is a difficult individual living a life of luxury who craves attention, she is not alone in her predicament,” writes Daniel Finkelstein in The Times. The problem for the Royal Family is that “the truth is that what has happened to the duchess has happened before”, most famously to Princess Diana. Therefore Prince Charles must examine what has “repeatedly” happened, and use the ongoing scandal as an “opportunity for modernisation”. “It is now his defining challenge.”

Dear Varkeychan,

The suspected murder of Sarah Everard has the potential to be one of those rare but terrible events that casts a light on broader, deeper ills.

It has certainly added a sense of urgency to the government’s Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy - a long-term project that has evidently not yet delivered on its promise.

After as-yet unidentified human remains were found yesterday in a wood in Kent, the “Reclaim These Streets” organisers said the event was “for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day”.

The 33-year-old’s disappearance has renewed debate about the endemic abuse as the government prepares its latest “violence against women and girls” strategy.

Newspapers reported that police in Clapham, south London, had warned women to be careful going out alone. “As if women need reminding to be careful,” Ferber says.

Met faces inquiry into Everard case
Watchdog will consider response to prior allegation against suspect

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Reports that the police officer suspected of killing Sarah Everard had been accused of indecent exposure a few days before she disappeared will bring fresh heartache for her family - and pile institutional pressure on the Met.

Already accused of failing to act on crimes against women, the force will now have to answer the claim that a more proactive response could have saved Everard’s life.

Daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Met faces inquiry into Everard case
Scotland Yard’s handling of an indecent exposure allegation against the officer suspected of murdering Sarah Everard will be investigated by the police watchdog. The Independent Office for Police Conduct will consider whether Metropolitan Police officers “responded appropriately” to the alleged incident, just days before the marketing executive disappeared. Everard, 33, was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March.

2 . Wales to relax lockdown
The “stay at home” order in Wales will be lifted and replaced by a “stay local” message this weekend. From Saturday, four people from two households will be able to meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens. In other changes, outdoor sports facilities will be able to reopen and indoor care home visits will restart for single designated visitors.

3 . Biden eyes Covid ‘independence’
Joe Biden said he hopes that America can “mark independence” from Covid on 4 July if people get vaccinated. The US president said he would order states to make all adults eligible for vaccinations by 1 May. Biden, who had set a target of administering 100 million vaccinations by his 100th day in office, said yesterday this target would be reached on day 60.

4 . Zaghari-Ratcliffe ‘suffers from PTSD’
The British-Iranian woman held in Iran since 2016 needs urgent treatment for her mental health, according to a charity which says she is suffering from serious depression and PTSD. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a new court hearing in Tehran this weekend, after her ankle tag was removed. The report was commissioned by the human rights charity Redress and sent to the British government.

5 . Nurses may get 2% rise
Nurses’ pay could increase by more than 2% under government plans to defuse mounting controversy, according to The Times. A government source said it was a matter of “when, not if” the current 1% offer is increased, adding that ministers are considering a rise of more than the 2.1% proposed by the NHS. The source also suggested that a rise of between 2% and 3% would be “realistic”.

6 . PM under pressure on women’s safety
Boris Johnson is under pressure to take action to tackle male violence and make the UK safer for women in the wake of the disappearance of Sarah Everard. During the annual International Women’s Day debate in the House of Commons, female MPs told stories of the harassment they had faced and called for tougher action from the government when the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill returns to the House of Commons.

7 . William says royals not racist

8 . New questions over Hancock ‘crony’

The Guardian says the exchange suggests Alex Bourne, a former publican who had no experience of producing medical devices before he began supplying the government, may have downplayed his relationship with Hancock in public.

Dear Varkeychan,

MPs accuse PM of pandering to ‘climate terrorists’
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion from Conservative MPs in the North after bowing to pressure to halt plans to build a coal mine in Cumbria.

Environmental groups are celebrating after Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick last night ordered a fresh public inquiry into the controversial project, effectively blocking the construction of the deep coal mining site.

But the decision sparked a flood of angry messages on WhatsApp groups of Tory MPs, who “have pounded Downing Street with furious complaints about the U-turn”, says The Sun.

Beijing’s parliament unanimously approved new legislation that will give China the power to “veto” Hong Kong election candidates “deemed unpatriotic” - making it “almost impossible for democracy activists to run for office”, The Times reports.

‘Johnson is an uneasy advocate for his government’s new approach’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. Chancellor Rishi Sunak may have imposed unpopular measures on the road to repairing the country’s finances post-pandemic, but “it’s far from clear whether the prime minister shares his appetite for that”, writes Stephen Bush in The i. Having “floundered” when facing questions from Keir Starmer on a pay rise for nurses, “the government is now signalling that a U-turn may be in the works”. Sunak’s budget is taking the government in a new direction, but the prime minister has suggested this week that he “is an at best uneasy advocate for the government’s new approach and way of doing things”.

Are Cressida Dick’s days at the Met numbered?
Police chief faces calls to resign

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The answer to the question in our headline appears to be no, but anyone who has heard the prime minister expressing full confidence in their position is bound to feel a bit precarious.

Nevertheless, many of the people unhappy with how the police handled Saturday night’s vigil want Cressida Dick to stay on and work out how to avoid the same thing happening again.

vigil fallout
Are Cressida Dick’s days at the Met numbered?
The recent history of the Metropolitan Police is strewn with complaints about overzealous policing of protests. From Black Lives Matter demonstrations to Extinction Rebellion shutdowns, the force has come under intense scrutiny over its approach to such gatherings.  

But rarely has the condemnation of the Met been as united as in the fallout from Saturday’s heavy-handed response to the vigil on Clapham Common for Sarah Everard, the murdered 33-year-old marketing executive.

The blame has fallen on Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, who hit out at “armchair critics” of officers making “really difficult calls”. The controversy is not the first in Dick’s career, leading to suggestions that the powerful images from the event may make it her last.

Why has the Oxford vaccine faced so much scrutiny?
European doubts persist despite positive UK data
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Right from the start, the Oxford vaccine led to questions as well as celebrations. The university had less experience designing clinical trials than Pfizer, Moderna and other big drugs companies, and its results were less clear-cut.

That (along with a large dose of politics) may help to explain some of Europe’s reluctance to use it, despite rising case numbers across the continent - and overwhelming evidence that the vaccine is safe and highly effective.

TODAY’S BIG QUESTION
Why has the Oxford jab faced so much scrutiny?

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is the jewel in the crown of the jab rollout that has so far seen over 24 million people receive at least one dose, with plans in place to ramp up to five million jabs every seven days in the coming weeks.

But despite the positive data emerging from the UK, the Oxford University-developed jab has repeatedly faced criticism and suspicion from European nations.

‘The biggest foreign policy shift since the Cold War’
Report calls for new relationships with key foreign powers

The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Foreign policy has, understandably, taken a back seat for the past year - but even before the pandemic talk of Britain’s place in the world tended to start and stop at Brexit.

Now the government is looking beyond our closest neighbours. The goal, it says, is an approach that’s both ethical and profitable - a tricky balancing act at the best of times (which these may not be).

‘The biggest foreign policy shift since the Cold War’
As the UK struggles to carve out a post-Brexit place in the world, Boris Johnson has laid out his vision for Britain’s defence and foreign policy.

Titled Global Britain in a Competitive Age, the 100-page government report is the “most radical reassessment of Britain’s place in the world since the end of the Cold War”, says The Times.

A key conclusion is that Britain must expand its influence in the Indo-Pacific region, which is described as being “increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world”.

Why the UK is facing a vaccine shortage

Dear Varkeychan,

‘Underpromise and overdeliver’ was the mantra we all got used to hearing in the first few weeks of the vaccination campaign. 

The problem is that we became so accustomed to overdelivery that merely meeting targets, which still looks likely, will feel like a bit of a letdown. This afternoon we look at what might have led to the change of pace.

Why the UK is facing a vaccine shortage
Just days ago, the government was preparing to ramp up the UK’s vaccination campaign to five million jabs every week. But now health bosses are being warned of an impending shortage of doses.

The NHS has said there will be a month-long “significant reduction” in weekly vaccine supply from the end of March. This means that, contrary to recent expectations, no one under the age of 50 in England will receive a first jab until May.

The news follows a threat by the EU to block vaccine exports to countries with high inoculation rates, including the UK.

So why have the Tories “given up” on the mayoral election? “Many Tories believe that they must be seen to be anti-London, with losing the capital a cheap investment to grab votes elsewhere”, Heath suggests. “But in abandoning Londoners to long-term decline, while simultaneously and mindlessly embracing Left-wing urbanism, it is betraying not just its electorate but also the country’s long-term interests.”

There is something fittingly biblical about carrying out a census at the end of a plague year.

Many people may feel unsure as to whether the English, Welsh and Northern Irish census of 2021 should be going ahead, given that it’s occurring during a pandemic when many aspects of our lives are far from normal. The census has actually been postponed by a year in Scotland due to these concerns.

Census timing has appeared unfortunate before. The 2001 census took place during the peak of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, amid concerns that census officials might spread the disease between farms.

Despite Cummings once being dubbed a “career psychopath”, No. 10 has seen “none of the vengeance that his enemies predicted”. In any case, “it’s not quite clear why the prime minister’s allies should be so worried about embarrassing disclosures”. Even if we learn that Johnson was distracted by “personal dramas” while co-ordinating the pandemic response, “when he won his majority, his complicated personal life was incredibly well-documented”.

Ban on export of Covid jabs to Britain threatens to slow campaign to inoculate population

Dear Varkeychan,

Europe is starting to see the lingering side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine fallout.

While Boris Johnson is apparently trying to temper threats of an export ban to the UK to avoid any delays in lifting lockdown, the recent decision by some EU countries to pause their AstraZeneca rollout appears to have caused a collapse in confidence in the jab - an adverse reaction that might prove hard to shake off.

Boris Johnson is expected to speak to his European counterparts this week in an effort to avoid further clashes that could threaten the UK’s speedy vaccination campaign.

Plans seen by The Mail on Sunday detail how the Buckingham Palace is seeking “independent views” on how to better represent ethnic minorities, disabled people and the gay and transgender communities. Aides across the Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace are taking part in a “listen and learn” exercise over the coming weeks and will be “speaking to a range of businesses and individuals about how the monarchy can improve representation”, the paper reports.

‘EU should crawl away in shame over its vaccination rollout’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press

1. “A new poll by YouGov of 8,000 people across seven European countries shows more people now consider the AZ jab unsafe than safe,” writes Patrick O’Flynn in The Telegraph. “A less arrogant political elite might detect that now would be a good time to crawl away in shame”, but the EU Commission is “doing just the opposite”. Why has the EU engaged in an “illogical” tussle over the exports of AstraZeneca vaccines? “The answer, I fear, is that this is now the only way in which the European Commission can demonstrate an advantage of EU membership to those still in the club,” O’Flynn says. “That advantage is that a country can avoid being beaten-up.”

Breakthroughs in vaccine science among much-needed silver linings of Covid pandemic
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The country fell silent today on the one-year anniversary of the first lockdown and paid tribute to those who have died from Covid-19.

It has been described as the “toughest year in living memory”, testing the limits of people’s physical and mental health, as well as the stability of their finances. The Week has searched high and low to find some positives to take away from an exceptionally difficult year.

Lockdown anniversary
Good things that came out of a terrible year
Exactly a year ago today, Boris Johnson gave a televised address to warn of the “biggest threat this country has faced for decades”.

Since then, everyday life in both the UK and worldwide has changed drastically as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with populations ordered to stay at home during lockdowns that have kept friends and families apart and triggered widespread job losses. Despite the tough restrictions, the coronavirus has claimed more than 2.7 million lives across the globe, including more than 126,000 in Britain.

But as the rollout of Covid vaccines provides light at the end of the tunnel, here we reflect on some of the other much-needed glimmers of hope that have emerged amid the devastation of the past 12 months.

1. “Boris Johnson’s whole political identity has always been as an optimistic, fun-loving, freedom-seeking libertarian”, writes Rachel Sylvester in The Times. Yet the pandemic has seen Johnson introduce “the greatest curtailment of liberties the country has ever known”. His “transformation from libertarian buccaneer to lockdown bureaucrat has infuriated the Tory right-wingers”, but “this does not bother Johnson”. “The public is overwhelmingly supportive of the lockdown restrictions and impressed by the vaccine rollout”, Sylvester says. And “these are the people on whom the prime minister believes his electoral success depends”.

The threat posed by spread of new coronavirus variants in Europe
Fresh lockdown measures imposed across continent as mutant Covid strains cause spike in infections
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Parliament is about to break up for Easter recess, and the prime minister appears to have been partaking in some end-of-term japes.

His comments about “capitalism” and “greed” fuelling the UK’s successful vaccine rollout were downplayed by his colleagues as “banter”, but he faced a scolding from critics. One area they want him to take seriously is the threat of new coronavirus variants in Europe.

Mutant strains
The threat posed by spread of new coronavirus variants in Europe
Angela Merkel is warning that Germany has been plunged into a “new pandemic” as coronavirus variants spreading across the country trigger a rapid rise in infections.

The German chancellor has joined a host of other European leaders in announcing an extension of lockdown measures as the continent struggles to contain new Covid strains.

France has introduced a partial lockdown on 16 regions, including the greater Paris area, while Italy has tightened restrictions until at least Easter, amid a stumbling continent-wide vaccination rollout that threatens to undermine the UK’s successful jab campaign.

Concerns over the impact of lockdowns on the younger generation have been “borne out” and culture has changed “perhaps irrevocably”, he continues.

Varkeychan, your 2-min introduction to today’s story from The Ken
Good Morning Varkeychan,
 
Before you continue reading, I'd recommend putting aside any food or beverage you may be consuming. Because today, I'm going to talk about cockroaches.
 
Hear me out.
 
They're known for being dirty and extremely revolting. You wouldn't want them anywhere near you. But despite the universal disgust directed towards them, cockroaches have survived on this planet for nearly 300 million years.
 
They survived the giant asteroid that took out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. They survived numerous natural and man-made disasters. Legend has it that they were even seen crawling through the rubble after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. Rest assured, they'll be here long after we humans wipe each other out. They might even take over the planet.
 
Why am I talking about cockroaches? Because Arundhati's story today is about a 22-year-old company that has shown similar survival skills. Nazara Technologies, a gaming firm, survived the 2000 dotcom crash and the entry of Reliance Jio in 2016, which killed mobile value-added services as a business.
 
It witnessed the launch and eventual demise of scores of other gaming platforms over two decades. But Nazara lived to tell the tale. It beat the odds via multiple pivots. After starting out by offering casual online games like Housie, then selling bulk SMS packs, and then mobile-based games, Nazara took a call in 2015 to become a holding company. It acquired gaming and esports companies, sports media platforms, and even an early-learning app.
 
Today, Nazara is on the verge of fetching around $80 million through an IPO later this month. Its IPO issue was oversubscribed 175.5 times last week. Analysts expect a market capitalisation of over $800 million after the listing.
 
 
 
Best,
Jaideep

The pros and cons of compulsory vaccination
MPs and publicans furious after PM endorses ‘vaccine passports’ for pubs
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Getting ID’d at the pub became a whole lot more controversial this week as the PM suggested pub-goers might have to prove they are vaccinated to get through the door.

It prompted fury from some of his own backbenchers, publicans and civil liberties activists, who said it was a move towards compulsory vaccination. Boris Johnson conceded that there are “moral complexities”. The Week has explored a few of these in this afternoon’s top briefing.

Free house?
Pros and cons of compulsory vaccination
Boris Johnson’s suggestion that pubs may require customers to show a vaccine certificate has left MPs and landlords outraged.

“It may be down to individual publicans” to decide whether to require proof that their customers are Covid-free, he told MPs yesterday.

The Guardian says the comments were “a far stronger endorsement of the widespread use of Covid certification than has previously been made by the prime minister”.

Short supplies
EU leaders are holding virtual talks today to discuss how to boost Covid vaccine supplies across the bloc, including new measures that could affect supply to the UK.

The European Commission proposed controversial new rules on Wednesday that would allow the EU to severely curtail the export of vaccines to places such as the UK and the US for up to six weeks. These are “countries that are either receiving EU-made vaccines but not sending other shots back, or that have vaccinated more of their population than the EU”, said Politico Europe.

‘The EU vaccine rollout has been so bad that lives have been lost’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “The European Union’s vaccine debacle is a cautionary tale about the perils of risk aversion”, writes Bruno Waterfield in The Times. “What’s clear is that the EU is unable to assess risk rationally and is too bureaucratically rigid to respond to fast-moving events.” The bloc’s inability to roll out the jab quickly has “been so bad that it is certain lives have been lost” as a “risk-averse institution managed to focus on entirely the wrong risks”. The EU’s vaccine campaign also has “big implications for the future of Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU”, he adds. After all, “given the events of the last two months, would Britain want to align itself with the EU’s political culture of risk aversion”?

PM issues warning as lockdown eased
Two households in England can now meet outside
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The return of the legal right to meet up to five other people outdoors in England will coincide with a few days of unseasonably warm weather, with temperatures set to reach 23C in some places.

It will be a welcome step forward for many, even if it comes with a prime ministerial instruction to maintain social distancing. For now, the joys of spring cannot be unconfined.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . PM issues warning as lockdown eased
Two households or groups of up to six people are now permitted to meet outside again as the stay-at-home order in England comes to an end. Outdoor sport facilities including tennis courts and golf courses are also reopening, and weddings are allowed again. On the eve of the change in rules, Boris Johnson warned that “everyone must continue to stick to the rules, remember hands, face, space, and come forward for a vaccine when called”.

2 . School abuse ‘next national scandal’
Police say that sexual harassment and assault claims made by school pupils may be the “next child abuse scandal that engulfs the nation”. After thousands of allegations were posted on the website Everyone’s Invited, a police helpline is to be set up to report incidents. The website has now received testimonies from children as young as nine. Most pointed the finger at other pupils.

3 . Suez ship ‘refloated’
A vast container ship that has been wedged in the Suez Canal since Tuesday has been refloated, according to reports. Footage on social media appeared to show that the stern of the Ever Given had been moved towards the canal bank, opening space in the channel. The 400m (1,312ft) long vessel became jammed diagonally across a southern section of the canal in high winds. The canal, which runs through Egypt, is one of the world’s busiest trade routes.

4 . Floyd murder trial to begin
The trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin starts today, ten months after the death of George Floyd. Key evidence in the hearing will be the video of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes during his arrest in May last year. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to the three charges against him - second and third degree murder and second degree manslaughter.

5 . Small firms suffer from Brexit
Small businesses have suffered a marked drop in exports to the EU, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. It said 35 of the 132 exporters it surveyed had temporarily suspended trade with the EU or stopped it permanently. UK exports to the EU fell by 41% in January, according to government figures. “It’s a nightmare,” said Sharon da Costa, the managing director of Fighting Films, a Bristol-based producer of judo movies.

6 . Report to suggest ‘scrapping BAME’
The term BAME should no longer be used by public bodies and companies, the government’s disparities commission will recommend this week. A report by the independent Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities is expected to say BAME has become “unhelpful and redundant”. The label is an acronym for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic. The report will also include research suggesting that the term “ethnic minority” is more popular with people from ethnic minorities than “BAME”.

7 . Girl critical after police chase
The Met has launched an investigation after a teenage girl was left in a critical condition after a car being chased by police crashed into a lamppost. On Sunday morning officers indicated for a car to stop near Streatham Common, but when it failed to do so, a chase began which ended when the car crashed into a lamppost on Greyhound Lane. Five women in the vehicle were taken to hospital.

8 . Jab checks ‘last straw’ for pubs
A vaccine passport scheme could be “the last straw” for hundreds of struggling pubs, Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin has claimed. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, he says that pubs are “hanging on for dear life” and have been “devastated by G-force changes of direction”. He adds that the passports proposal would force reluctant bar staff on to the front line of the Covid battle for civil liberties.

9 . Slough to become ‘sponge city’
Selected roads in Slough are to benefit from the flood defence of permeable surfaces that soak up surface water. Pioneered in China, the “sponge city” project involves turning a proportion of urban land into features that absorb rain and flood water. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said the move will help “reinforce the UK's position as a world leader in innovation and new technology”.

10 . Brisbane locks down on seven cases
The Australian city of Brisbane will go into another three-day lockdown to contain a Covid outbreak that has grown to seven cases. The Queensland state capital - home to more than two million residents, has suffered very few locally acquired cases since Australia’s first wave of the virus a year ago. In January, the city shut down for three days due to a single case.

How the #MeToo movement in UK schools began
Major investigation launched after outpouring of sexual harassment allegations in schools
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Children are leaving school believing that sexual harassment is part of growing up, Maria Miller, former women’s minister, warned today.

The ever-growing number of testimonials on the website Everyone’s Invited certainly gives that impression, with police calling it the next national scandal.

Thousands of pupils have reported abuse - lessons no child should ever have to learn.

'National scandal'
How the #MeToo movement in UK schools began
Whitehall has launched a major investigation into the emerging “rape culture” scandal in UK schools.

Officials from the Home Office, Department for Education and Department of Health are working with senior police officers and Ofsted to look at the huge number of allegations, which one police chief has called the education sector’s “MeToo” moment.

It was a website called Everyone’s Invited that “started a revolution in our schools”, says the Evening Standard. It was set up last year by Soma Sara, 22, a sex abuse survivor, for past and present pupils to report claims of sexual harassment.

Boris Johnson says roadmap on course
Shops, pubs and restaurants set to reopen in a fortnight
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Boris Johnson has told the public to use their new-found freedom “to play sport, to take exercise, to have fun and build our national resilience”.

The prime minister added that data suggests the next stage of lifting lockdown, scheduled for 12 April, should go ahead as planned.

However, he rejected calls to speed up the process, warning that we do not know “how strong our fortifications now are [or] how robust our defences are against another wave”.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . PM says roadmap on course
Boris Johnson has said England is on course for the reopening of shops, pubs and restaurants in a fortnight. The prime minister said he had not seen anything in the latest coronavirus data “that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap”. However, he also warned the while the public should go out and “have fun” as lockdown restrictions are eased, they should still abide by the rules and “remain humble in the face of nature”.

2 . Suez open as vessel freed
Traffic has resumed in the Suez Canal after the container ship blocking it was freed by salvage crews. Tug boats honked their horns in celebration as the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was dislodged with the help of dredgers. The Guardian says insurers, the shipping industry and the thousands of businesses reliant on container goods are “still counting the cost of the accident”.

3 . Floyd murder trial begins
A witness has said that George Floyd was “slowly fading away” during the nine minutes that Derek Chauvin kneeled on his back and neck in May last year. In their opening statement, Chauvin’s lawyer argued his use of force was “unattractive but necessary”, adding that the evidence “is far greater than nine minutes and 29 seconds” of video footage. The BBC reports that the trial is being seen by many as a “pivotal moment in US race relations”.

4 . Bezos orders fightback
Jeff Bezos has complained that company officials are not aggressive enough in how they react to criticisms of the internet giant, Vox reports. The Amazon CEO’s call to be more active in refuting allegations comes as the Amazon News Twitter account and executive Dave Clark recently began lashing out at critics online. The Guardian describes Bezos’ new confrontational stance as a “Trumpian move”. The web giant is currently facing the largest union election in its history at a warehouse in Alabama.

5 . WHO reports on Covid origin
A World Health Organization (WHO) draft report has found that Covid-19 probably emerged through human contact with an animal, and likely started spreading no more than a month or two before it was noticed in December 2019. Other WHO theories over its origin include transmission from frozen or chilled food, or, in a less likely scenario, an accidental laboratory release. The WHO identified tracking the origins of Covid-19 as a “priority research area” back in February 2020, but “has been quick to temper expectations” about how quickly the project will be concluded, The Telegraph says.

6 . New charges for Maxwell
Court papers show that Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite accused of aiding in her former partner Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse, faces two additional charges. An indictment identified a new accuser, referred to as “minor victim-4” in court papers, and expanded the timeframe of Maxwell’s alleged participation in Epstein’s abuse by seven years – from 1994 to 2004. Maxwell now faces a total of eight counts, including four related to the years between 1994 and 1997, when prosecutors say she helped Epstein groom girls. The other two are allegations of perjury in 2016.

7 . Brits in France lose licences
British citizens living in France have been left without a valid driving licence, or face losing theirs within months, because of the failure of the two nations’ governments to sign a post-Brexit agreement. “Commuters risk losing their jobs, tradespeople can’t work [and] elderly people have missed medical appointments”, Kim Cranstoun, who moved permanently to France three years ago, told The Guardian. Government sources insist a UK-France reciprocity agreement is “close to being sealed”.

8 . Brazilian minister stands down
An ultraconservative foreign minister in Brazil has resigned after diplomats and lawmakers accused him of damaging the nation’s reputation and putting lives at risk by wrecking relations with China. Ernesto Araújo, a 53-year-old career diplomat and close ally of President Jair Bolsonaro, became notorious for his criticism of Xi Jinping’s China, while pouring praise on former US president Donald Trump. “One thing’s for sure, he’s the worst foreign minister Brazil has ever had,” said Celso Amorim, a predecessor of Araújo.

9 . PM calls for global pandemic plan
Boris Johnson has joined more than 20 world leaders to call for a new global settlement to help the world prepare for future pandemics. Global leaders, including Emmanuel Macron of France and Germany’s Angela Merkel, said another pandemic or health crisis is a matter of “not if, but when”, adding that the current crisis has shown that “nobody is safe until everyone is safe”.

10 . Angry gardener ‘drowned cat’
A court has heard that a gardener drowned his neighbour’s cat because it kept digging up his vegetable plot. Richard Giles, 69, drowned the tabby cat, named Ruby, after becoming angry with her for “ruining” his patch of carrots and leeks. Weymouth Magistrates’ Court was told he drowned the cat in a water butt. Giles has admitted the offence, which carries a maximum sentence of up to six months in prison.

today’s newspapers
‘What are we waiting for?’
“What are we waiting for?” asks the Daily Mail’s splash this morning as Boris Johnson faces mounting calls to lift lockdown faster. The Times reports that the prime minister believes there is nothing in the most recent data “that would cause us to deviate from the roadmap” for ending the third national shutdown.

Johnson has joined other world leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, in calling for a global settlement similar to that formed after World War Two to protect from future pandemics. Writing in The Telegraph, they say the virus has been a “stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe”.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror says the prime minister is facing an investigation over claims he gave US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri special treatment during his time as mayor of London. Arcuri this week confirmed suspicions that she and Johnson had a four year affair.

Dear Varkeychan,

The trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin continues this afternoon, a day after jurors heard opening arguments and witness testimony on the killing of George Floyd.

One witness was a 911 dispatcher who said officers pinned Floyd down for so long she thought her security video feed had frozen.

Despite the footage, prosecutors face a number of challenges in what has become a crucial juncture for America’s race relations.

George Floyd
The challenges for prosecutors in the Derek Chauvin trial
Derek Chauvin’s use of force against George Floyd was “unattractive but necessary”, lawyers for the former Minnesota police officer have argued at the opening of his murder trial.

Defence lawyer Eric Nelson told the jury yesterday that “the evidence is far greater than nine minutes and 29 seconds” of video footage showing Floyd’s death during his arrest last May by police including Chauvin, who denies all of the charges against him.

As demonstrators rallied outside the Minneapolis court, the first prosecution witness later testified that Floyd was “slowly fading away” as Chauvin kneeled on his neck. “His eyes slowly rolled to the back of his head” until “he didn’t have no life in him no more”, the witness said.

Bright. Very bright”. Even “Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen might have blushed at the brilliant blue lustre used as background”. Its oak panelling “reminded me of Judge Rinder’s daytime TV set. Or was it more Premier Inn?”, he wonders. Either way, “the setting may have been new but otherwise much of what the PM had to say was painfully familiar”.

Is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine safe?
Germany becomes latest country to partially halt use of the jab
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Germany initially banned the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for over-65s over doubts about its efficacy in older people, before changing its mind. It then paused the jab’s rollout over fears about rare blood clots, before restarting the campaign when EU regulators said it was safe and effective. Now it is advising against the use of the jab for under-60s over fresh fears about clotting.

“All this will bring uncertainty,” Chancellor Angela Merkel admits. But Germany is not the only country seesawing on the vaccine. This afternoon’s top story looks at why.

However, “the SNP’s plans, like the Brexit campaign itself, promise speculative benefits while ignoring real trade-offs”. Were Scotland to rejoin, “it would enjoy some gains from being part of its internal market but at the price of erecting trade barriers to the rest of the UK”, Kamm says, while “the concessions previously enjoyed by the UK within the EU, such as the budget rebate and opting out of the euro, would probably not be on offer.” If Scotland plans to pursue a strategy of getting their feet back under the table in Brussels, they will have to recognise that “EU governments want Britain back but not at any price”.

What a third wave of Covid might mean for the UK
Scientists warn that ‘baseline measures’ will still be needed after lockdown is fully lifted
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Boris Johnson’s confirmation that shops, hairdressers and outdoor hospitality will reopen next Monday has been somewhat dampened by scientific modelling showing the risks of a third wave of coronavirus later in the year.

Reports that the UK medicines regulator is investigating the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the growing opposition to Covid passports, might also spoil the PM’s spirits. At least he can drown his sorrows in a real-life pub garden next week.

‘Grim assessment’
What a third wave of Covid might mean for the UK
The lockdown easing steps planned for May and June risk unleashing a third wave of coronavirus as deadly as that which hit the UK over winter, government scientists have warned.

The newly published predictions from the outbreak modelling subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) put a dampener on Boris Johnson’s announcement last night that England’s roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown was on track.

The prime minister confirmed that hairdressers, gyms and non-essential shops, as well as outdoor areas of pubs and restaurants, can reopen as planned from 12 April.

‘Vaccine passports are heading from unthinkable to unstoppable’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “The biggest question facing Boris Johnson is the future of his so-called vaccine passports,” writes Fraser Nelson in The Spectator. “A few months ago, the idea was dismissed by No. 10 as ‘discriminatory’.” But fast-forward to now and, “without debate or democratic scrutiny, vaccine passports are quickly heading from unthinkable to unstoppable”. The conclusion of the government’s first lockdown review, published this weekend, “primarily looks at vaccine passports and international travel”, Nelson continues. “It clearly says that vaccine identity cards could be demanded ‘in hospitality settings’ - in other words, in pubs.” And that means that “contrary to what some of the weekend papers had been briefed, a passport for the pub is a live idea”.

Under-30s to be offered alternative to Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine
UK regulator says evidence of a link between the jab and very rare blood clots is ‘firming up’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Elle Taylor, a 24-year-old carer from Carmarthenshire, said she was “very excited and very happy” as she became the first person in Britain to receive the Moderna vaccine this morning.

The Moderna jab has arrived just in time to bolster the country’s vaccination programme, as the medicines regulator this afternoon announced that under-30s should be given an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Our top story explores why.

‘Still safe’
Under-30s to be offered alternative to AstraZeneca
The UK medicines regulator has said people under 30 should be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to concerns about rare and unusual blood clotting.

As a precautionary measure, people aged 18 to 29 should be given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine instead, said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The regulator said there was not yet proof that the jab had caused the clots, but that evidence of such a link was “firming up”. It stressed that the cases were extremely rare and, for most age groups, the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks.

Keir Starmer is facing potential disaster in the first major ballot box test of his leadership as latest polls suggest that a stronghold of Labour’s “Red Wall” will turn blue in next month’s by-election.

The 6 May vote in the constituency of Hartlepool in County Durham was triggered by the resignation of Labour MP Mike Hill, who is due to face an employment tribunal later this year into claims of sexual harassment and victimisation. Hill has denied the allegations, but the row threatens to result in a major loss for his party, which has held Hartlepool since the seat was created back in 1974.

Red Wall sees Starmer as ‘Mr Man-on-the-fence’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “No politician can be anything other than themselves for long. They just look phoney, pointless, dull or too obviously calculating,” writes Daniel Finkelstein for The Times. This, he says, is a lesson Keir Starmer “would do well to reflect upon”. Starmer “is a successful liberal lawyer”, “a southerner, a graduate and a London MP who lives in his constituency”, says Finkelstein, and these are “all good qualities”. But he has become “a leader who’s afraid of being himself and wishing to be seen as someone else”, he writes. Starmer “desperately wants to be the voice of the red wall seats for whom he is not the authentic voice”, says Finkelstein. “And voters can see it.” Focus groups “call him ‘Mr Man-on-the-fence’ and say that he only jumps off the fence to climb on to a passing bandwagon”.

The AstraZeneca blood clot risk in context
Experts say odds of adverse side effect are about same as ‘being hit in your home by crashing aeroplane’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

There are plenty of statistics doing the rounds today to show why the benefits of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine still far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of adults.

But it was a surprising human voice that cut through the numbers and offered a boost in confidence for the jab. The sister of Neil Astles, the first named Briton to die from a blood clot on the brain after having the AstraZeneca vaccine, said her “much loved” brother was “extraordinarily unlucky” and was firm that people should still “go ahead and have the vaccine”.

Weighing up
The AstraZeneca blood clot risk in context
Confidence in the UK’s Covid vaccination programme risks being undermined by news that under-30s will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab as a result of blood clot concerns, experts have warned.

Government scientists and ministers are expected to “embark on a media blitz” to persuade the public that the vaccine is still safe following the announcement by regulators, The Times reports. And media outlets have also been putting the risk into context.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) issued a statement yesterday about “extremely rare” cases of blood clots combined with low platelet counts in a small number of people who had the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. No such cases have been reported in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, the independent advisory body said.

The questions David Cameron needs to answer
Government announces review into the Greensill scandal
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

When David Cameron predicted in 2010 that lobbying was the “next big scandal waiting to happen”, it is unlikely he foresaw himself at the centre of the fallout.

Eleven years on, he insists he has not broken any rules in his work for Greensill. However, his conduct has raised questions about the adequacy of laws brought in by his own coalition to tackle - in the words of the former PM - “the far-too-cosy relationship between politics, government, business and money”.

Breaking silence
The questions David Cameron needs to answer
No 10 has announced an investigation that will look into David Cameron’s lobbying on behalf of Greensill Capital. Lawyer Nigel Boardman will lead the independent review of the now-collapsed finance firm’s activities in government.

The news comes after the former prime minister issued a public statement last night for the first time since he was accused of lobbying the government using personal messages to the chancellor on behalf of the financial services firm before it went bust.

Although he has been cleared of breaking lobbying rules or codes of conduct, his critics say there are still questions that remain unanswered.

Why the marriage of Prince Philip and the Queen was ‘last of its kind’
In November 1947, a dynastic union was forged between the royal houses of Greece and Great Britain. It would be one of the last of this kind of royal marriages in history - a type of union that had knitted together the continent for 1,000 years.

When Philip, prince of Greece and Denmark married Elizabeth, princess of Great Britain, they reconnected two bloodlines descended from Queen Victoria. But they also renewed a kinship tie between Britain and Denmark that had been joined together numerous times, from Canute and Aelfgifu in 1015 to Edward VII and Alexandra in 1863.

But not only has the government declined to fix the “hostile environment” for migrants to the UK, but it is also now “putting thousands more children in care at risk of this fate as a consequence of Brexit”. The deadline is fast approaching for EU citizens living in the UK to apply for the right to remain. “Local authorities have to do this for children in care,” notes Sodha. “But the Children’s Society has established through Freedom of Information requests that, so far, fewer than 40% of the 3,700 or so eligible children in care and care leavers we know about have applications in,” she writes. “The government was warned again and again about the consequences of its policies for the Windrush generation, to no avail. Will they listen this time?”

While much of the world remains under lockdown, the UK yesterday offered a tantalising glimpse of a return to normality as pubs and hospitality venues reopened after almost four months of Covid restrictions.

“Chilly weather” failed to deter Brits who “flocked to shed shaggy locks and browse for clothes, books and other ‘non-essential’ items”, as shops, gyms and hairdressers also welcomed back customers, says The Washington Post.

“Long lines formed outside some stores”, the paper continues, and restaurants and pubs reported a “flood of bookings” as people across England planned “outdoor meals and drinks, despite unseasonably cold weather that brought springtime snow flurries to many areas”.

If the Labour leader is right that Greensill is just “the tip of the iceberg”, a wider investigation into lobbying across Whitehall would have even Ted Hastings sighing “Mother of God”.

The Conservatives were accused of tolerating a “sleazy culture” today as they were ordered to vote down a parliamentary inquiry into the Greensill Capital lobbying fallout.

Labour has been pushing for a broader inquiry into lobbying than the one set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as a senior civil servant became embroiled in the row.

“If there was greater transparency... I think things would be very different. I don’t think you would have this sort-of sleazy culture being allowed to develop. That’s why we need tougher rules,” shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves told Times Radio. Here are the most high-profile people involved.

‘The assumptions of postwar politics are crumbling’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. The death of Prince Philip is a reminder we are “coming to the end of the postwar era and are entering the post-postwar world”, writes Daniel Finkelstein in The Times. “The assumptions of postwar politics are crumbling,” he says. As a description, “postwar” denoted the world order and was synonymous with modernity, but these are “no longer universal assumptions”, writes Finkelstein. “In particular they are not the assumptions of new generations of voters.” There are examples of this, “big and small”. Firstly, “American power” and the country’s “status as a success story that demanded emulation” is “much more widely questioned”. As the Cold War recedes in memory too, those “wishing to associate capitalism with prosperity and freedom” are no longer able to “rely on the immediate postwar experience of communism to make the argument for them”, says the writer. “All these changes mean that it no longer makes sense to talk with ease about our era as postwar,” he adds. “Maybe we need a new term. Post-Covid?”

US allies fear ‘retaliatory attacks’ after Joe Biden sets Afghanistan withdrawal date
US allies fear that Joe Biden’s decision to renege on Donald Trump’s date for withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan could lead to a wave of Taliban attacks on Nato military and diplomatic personnel.

In a speech yesterday, Biden said that it was “time to end America’s longest war”, announcing that US troops would “come home” on 11 September 2021, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.

A meeting of the North Atlantic Council at Nato’s Brussels headquarters saw a “tense” discussion of Biden’s plans, Politico reports, with some allies voicing concerns over “retaliatory attacks”, as well as fears that it is “too early for an orderly withdrawal of troops”.

Breakaway football clubs join European league
Six English clubs among breakaway dozen
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

After a year of upheaval, the creation of a new European football tournament might seem like small beer - but the intervention of prime ministers and presidents across the continent suggests otherwise.

At stake, according to all those who oppose the new league - which seems to be everyone not in it - is the soul of the sport. The breakaway clubs would enjoy great riches, but those left behind would struggle to compete.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Breakaway clubs join European league
Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham have come under fire after agreeing to join a new European Super League - a “seismic move”, says the BBC. The Premier League clubs will join AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid in the new competition. Boris Johnson, Fifa, Uefa and the Premier League have all condemned the move, along with several fans’ organisations which say it is motivated by greed.

2 . Poverty causes crime, says top cop
A police chief has stated that tackling poverty and inequality is the best way to reduce crime. In an interview to mark his retirement as chief constable of Merseyside police, Andy Cooke said that if he was given £5bn to cut crime, he would put £1bn into law enforcement and £4bn into tackling poverty. “The best crime prevention is increased opportunity and reduced poverty,” he said. “That’s the best way to reduce crime.”

3 . Patel criticises Facebook encryption
Priti Patel says Facebook is “blinding” itself to the issue of child abuse by adopting new security measures that will make it more difficult to catch paedophiles. Demanding that tech giants “take the safety of children as seriously as they do the business of selling advertising, phones and online games”, the home secretary will call for Facebook to rethink plans for all messaging on its platforms to be “end-to-end” encrypted.

4 . Floyd trial verdict due
Protests have broken out across the US as Americans wait for a verdict in the trial of the white police officer charged with murdering George Floyd last year. With closing arguments expected in Derek Chauvin’s trial today, tensions are growing in several cities. The most serious charge the former officer is facing is second-degree murder, but The Guardian says the jury might choose to find him guilty on third-degree murder or manslaughter, or acquit him altogether.

5 . Harry and William ‘spoke at Windsor’
Prince Harry and Prince William reunited for two hours after the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral, according to reports. The Sun says the brothers joined Prince Charles for the first time since Harry and wife Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey “threatened to tear the family apart”. Charles held private talks with his warring sons after the Windsor Castle ceremony, raising hopes that their rift can be healed.

6 . Deaths in Egypt train crash
At least 11 people have been killed and 98 injured when a train derailed near the city of Toukh, north of Cairo. The Egyptian Railways Authority said it was still investigating what caused the Cairo-to-Mansoura train to crash. It was the third major rail accident Egypt in less than a month. At least 32 people were killed and 165 injured in March when two trains collided.

7 . US warns Russian on Navalny
Washington has told Russia there will be “consequences” if the Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny dies in jail. Navalny’s doctors say he “will die within the next few days” if he does not receive urgent medical attention for acute back pain and leg numbness. However, Russia’s ambassador to the UK has said that Navalny is attention seeking and “will not be allowed to die in prison”.

8 . Spies could be deported
Foreign spies in Britain could be prosecuted and deported under new laws, according to The Times. Boris Johnson is set to announce a bill next month to counter hostile states, including a requirement for all individuals working on behalf of foreign governments in Britain to register their presence. There is growing concern over the espionage activities of Russia and China.

9 . Covid tests could be VAT-free
Covid tests for holidaymakers could fall below £50 as the Treasury considers plans to exempt them from VAT. The government has already ruled that PCR tests will be exempt from VAT when they are administered or overseen by a registered nurse, but now all tests may be excluded from the 20% tax. Prices range from £60 to £300 per test.

10 . De Niro ‘being forced to act’
Robert De Niro is unable to turn down acting roles because he must pay for his estranged wife’s expensive tastes, according to his lawyer. Caroline Krauss told a Manhattan court that the Hollywood legend is struggling financially partly due to the demands of Grace Hightower, who filed for divorce in 2018. “Mr De Niro is 77 years old, and while he loves his craft, he should not be forced to work at this prodigious pace,” Krauss told the court.

today’s newspapers
‘Loneliest birthday’
The Sun says that Prince William and Harry were “united in grief” as the estranged brothers spoke for two hours after their grandfather’s funeral on Saturday. The Daily Mail says the Queen will have the “loneliest birthday” as she turns 95 on Wednesday.

Football hits the front pages today with plans for a European football Super League prompting an intervention from Downing Street. Boris Johnson has urged the six English clubs who have signed up to the plan not to progress any further, notes The Times.

Meanwhile, The Guardian quotes a retiring chief constable who says the best way to reduce crime is to cut poverty and inequality. Andy Cooke tells the paper that if he were given £5bn to slash crime, he would use £4bn to tackle poverty.

Police struggled to ‘keep up’ with confusing Covid laws
Watchdog warns ministers that regulations are passed in Parliament rather than ‘from a podium’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The image of ministers announcing new coronavirus rules from behind a lectern has become a familiar sight on televisions across the nation.

But this week the police watchdog has pointed out that this is not where the country’s laws are made. The ever-changing guidance issued by the government left not only the public confused, but also the very people tasked with policing the pandemic.

‘Widespread confusion’
Police struggled to ‘keep up’ with confusing coronavirus laws
UK police forces have “felt disadvantaged by a lack of notice and consultation” about Covid laws, according to inspectors.

The newly published “Policing in the Pandemic” report, from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, says that some police chiefs first learned about last year’s law changes from the government’s daily televised briefing.

The police watchdog says “it was hard to keep up” with the regulations, which were amended and supplemented a “considerable number of times” as “lockdown restrictions were eased or strengthened, imposed, relaxed and re-imposed, in different parts of the country, for different periods and with differing intensities”.

Can Dominic Cummings sink Boris Johnson?
Ally warns that PM’s former aide ‘knows where all the bodies are buried’
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Dominic Cummings exited the political stage through the famous No. 10 front door with a theatrical flourish last year - lugging a large storage box.

While some critics celebrated his departure, Tories are now apparently “terrified” about what else the maverick former aide has carried out of Downing Street. According to his allies, it is a “treasure chest” of emails, memos and texts that threaten to embarrass his former boss.

The big fight
Can Dominic Cummings sink Boris Johnson?
The briefing war between Boris Johnson and the man who was once his most influential adviser is raging on in the newspapers today.

Downing Street is engaged in what the Daily Mail describes as a “spectacular public war of words” with Dominic Cummings, the Brexit campaign architect who was booted out of his role as Johnson’s chief of staff late last year.

Some Tory insiders fear the maverick former aide has enough material to damage the prime minister.

The Indian government is massively underreporting the scale of the country’s Covid crisis, experts are claiming.

India recorded 349,691 new cases yesterday - setting a new global record for the fifth consecutive day - and 2,767 coronavirus deaths. But medical workers say those totals, “however staggering”, represent just “a fraction of the real reach of the virus’s spread, which has thrown the country into emergency mode”, The New York Times reports.

Expert's view
Why inflation might surge after the Covid pandemic
Inflation is rising again in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. Prices in March rose 0.7% compared to a year earlier, against a 0.4% rise in February. One of the main drivers was that fuel prices have seen their biggest increase since January 2020.

This rise in inflation is roughly in line with what analysts were expecting. The Bank of England has been expecting inflation to rise this spring as well, but thinks it will then settle down.

‘Radical policy changes are needed to fix the housing crisis’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “Securing a place to call one’s own is a key marker of independence, and a step towards starting a family,” says the Financial Times in its leader column. “Yet for many young people, across many countries, a home has become unaffordable and renting is insecure, expensive, or both – especially in places where the good jobs they want are most plentiful,” the paper continues. “[U]nless they enjoy support from the ‘bank of mum and dad’ or are exceptionally well paid, many in the younger generation are stuck as ‘generation rent’.” One of the most crucial issues the UK government must tackle is the “inadequate growth in supply, including of affordable housing”. Fixing the housing crisis will take “some radical policy changes. It is time to embrace them,” the paper concludes.

British-Iranian mother jailed for a further year after being found guilty of ‘propaganda’ in Iran

Dear Varkeychan,

The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, sentenced to another year in prison in Iran, revealed today that he has not yet broken the news to their daughter Gabriella, who had been counting down the days until she could see her mother again.

The fresh heartbreak of her family should provide plenty of motivation for the UK government to do all it can to help them reunite after years of Zaghari-Ratcliffe being used as a political pawn.

Confirming the charges against his wife, Richard Ratcliffe said the decision was “clearly a negotiating tactic” by Tehran, with discussions over the country’s nuclear programme currently ongoing in Vienna.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s lawyer said the charges related to a demonstration she attended outside the Iranian embassy in London 12 years ago, after which she gave an interview to the BBC Persian service.

Will Tory sleaze storm affect the May elections?
Boris Johnson is holding a cabinet meeting today as No. 10 battles to reclaim the political agenda amid a flurry of sleaze allegations less than two weeks before the UK goes to the polls.

The government has been hit by a series of embarrassing claims about lobbying; the “revolving door” between politics and business; potentially rule-breaking messages via text and Whatsapp; the refurbishment of the prime minister’s flat; and allegations by former key adviser Dominic Cummings of “unethical” behaviour in No. 10.

In a letter to the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group that “appears to kick Boris Johnson’s promise of an inquiry into the long grass”, says The Guardian, the government's legal department argues that “an inquiry now is not appropriate” because ministers and officials are too busy.

‘Rampant Covid in poorer countries will shape the evolution of the virus’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

Last week there were more than 5.8 million new cases of Covid across the world, the highest number yet, says Laura Spinney in The Guardian. The “sharpest upticks” have been seen in south-east Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and western Pacific regions, while the “situation is also very bad in Latin America”. We can be confident that poorer countries will contribute most of this year’s Covid deaths and “we should remember that rich countries are not immune from what happens beyond their shores”, says Spinney. “Rampant Covid in countries such as India and Brazil will shape the evolution of the virus and could cause new, even more dangerous variants to emerge, which neither our borders nor our vaccines are guaranteed to keep out.”

India passes 200,000 Covid deaths
New variant pushing healthcare system to breaking point
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

Over the past week almost half of the world’s new Covid infections and around one in six deaths have occurred in a single country.

India, the self-proclaimed “pharmacy of the world”, is firmly in the grip of the most devastating Covid wave on the planet, with cases topping 300,000 per day and hospitals pushed beyond breaking point.

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . India passes 200,000 Covid deaths
India’s Covid death toll has passed the 200,000 mark in another grim milestone for a nation facing what the BBC describes as a “ferocious” second wave. Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, said countries have failed to unite to prevent the “tragic” outbreak from overwhelming India. With only 1.6% of the population fully vaccinated, former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said the G7 must act to end “vaccine apartheid”.

2 . Nearly 40m in ‘Covid-free’ areas
More than 38 million people in England live in areas that are virtually Covid-free, The Times reports. Analysis by the paper found that seven in 10 people live in areas where a maximum of two infections were reported during the most recent week for which data is available. Alastair Grant, a professor of ecology at the University of East Anglia, said “the virus is retreating to small areas”. However, he added that many of the remaining hotspots are “deprived inner-city areas”.

3 . Foster facing DUP rebellion
Arlene Foster is facing a revolt from Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) members that could topple her as party leader and first minister of Northern Ireland. Several DUP assembly members have signed a letter calling for an “unprecedented leadership contest”, the BBC reports. The Guardian says a leadership challenge would “add further turmoil to a region already rattled by street disturbances linked to the post-Brexit Irish Sea border”.

4 . Self-driving cars allowed this year
Motorists could legally allow their cars to “self-drive” on British motorways later this year, the government has announced. The Department for Transport said the first vehicles fitted with Automated Lane Keeping Systems could be permitted to steer themselves in slow moving traffic before the end of 2021. Use of the system, which takes over control of the vehicle at low speeds, for example keeping it in lane on motorways, will be capped at 37mph (60 kph).

5 . Dyson slams ‘grotesque’ reports
James Dyson has accused the BBC of a “grotesque mischaracterisation” of his links with the Conservative Party. Writing in The Telegraph, the British inventor and billionaire denied trying to “extract favours from the prime minister”. Dyson hit the headlines last week when the BBC published messages showing that he sought clarification from Boris Johnson on UK tax matters related to building ventilators during the pandemic.

6 . Conservatives tell Johnson to own up
Tory MPs are demanding that Boris Johnson comes clean about the funding of his flat refurbishment. The prime minister has faced “growing disquiet” from within his own party following claims that he was loaned £58,000 from Conservative party funds, The Guardian says. It comes after the paper revealed that former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling refused to join a trust overseeing Downing Street upkeep citing “the potential for donors to expect political favours”.

7 . ‘Terrific’ data on vaccine efficacy
A single dose of a Covid vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half, a new study has revealed. Public Health England found that those given a first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines - and who became infected three weeks later - were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on than unvaccinated people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the data, describing it as “terrific news”.

8 . Idaho joins anti-abortion ‘flurry’
Idaho has signed into law a ban on most abortions at the onset of a fetal heartbeat, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. “We should never relent in our efforts to protect the lives of the preborn”, said Republican governor Brad Little as he announced the bill had been signed. CNN reports that there has been a “flurry” of anti-abortion bills in the early months of the Biden administration, including the introduction of similar measures in Oklahoma and Montana.

today’s newspapers
‘Come clean, Boris’
The Guardian leads on reports that Boris Johnson is being “urged to come clean” about the funding of his 11 Downing Street flat refurbishment. The PM is facing “growing disquiet” among senior Tories over allegations surrounding a £58,000 loan from Tory Party HQ, the paper says. “Cash for curtains” is the Daily Mirror’s splash as it says the PM is “mired in scandal”.

The Daily Mail reports that self-driving cars are to be legal on UK motorways this year. The paper adds that there are concerns drivers “will be able to check their emails and watch TV” under plans to legalise the technology within months.

“June olé days” is The Sun’s headline as it reports that the Spanish tourism minister has confirmed June as “the start of the recovery of tourism in Spain”.

Why the DUP turned on Arlene Foster
Northern Ireland first minister resigns after revolt from party representatives

Dear Varkeychan,

This morning, Arlene Foster’s leadership was said to be “hanging by a thread” following a revolt from within the DUP.

This afternoon, the Northern Ireland first minister decided to cut the thread herself. Our top story looks at the reasons why Foster’s position became so precarious.

‘Britain has a potentate in place of a prime minister’
Your digest of analysis and commentary from the British and international press.

1. “Instead of a cabinet, Britain has courtiers. In place of a prime minister, there is a potentate,” writes Rafael Behr in The Guardian. “The traditional structures still exist, but as tributes to an obsolescent way of governing.” There are still secretaries of state, but they now have “little bearing on real power, which swirls in an unstable vortex of advisers and officials vying for proximity to Boris Johnson’s throne”. Behr continues that “having such a personality at the heart of government makes a nonsense of unwritten protocol” that governs British politics. “It was never rigorous. All manner of hypocrisies flourish when a self-selecting elite chooses the boundaries of legitimate behaviour. But there were boundaries. Johnsonism has none.”

Dear Varkeychan,

Watching Boris Johnson tell reporters there is “nothing to see here” over the Downing Street refurbishment furore today was much like watching The Naked Gun’s Frank Drebin saying the same in front of an exploding fireworks factory.

The question for the PM is just how far the “cash for curtains” row might blow up.

Cash for curtains
Will No. 10 refurb inquiry end up costing PM?
The Conservatives are facing an Electoral Commission inquiry over allegations that a donor originally paid for renovations to Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat.

The political finances watchdog has said that the party’s compliance with laws on donations will be assessed because “there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred”.

The inquiry has the potential “to imperil Boris Johnson’s premiership”, The Guardian warned following yesterday’s announcement, as the so-called “cash for curtains” row “rapidly engulfed” the prime minister.

Conservatives triumph in Hartlepool
Starmer faces questions about Labour’s direction
facebook twitter google+
The Week

Dear Varkeychan,

The first result from yesterday’s bumper crop of elections - a Conservative win deep in Labour territory - had been widely trailed, but the wide margin of victory was more of a surprise.

Digital Director,

daily briefing
Ten things you need to know today
1 . Conservatives triumph in Hartlepool
Hartlepool has a Conservative MP for the first time since the seat was created in 1974 after the Labour candidate Paul Williams attracted little more than half the votes of his Tory rival Jill Mortimer. The by-election was “a key test of Labour’s appeal to its traditional heartlands”, says The Guardian, and defeat will leave “Keir Starmer facing huge questions over the future direction of his party”.

2 . Economy bouncing back, says Bank
The Bank of England says Britain is on course for its strongest year of economic growth since the Second World War as households splash their lockdown savings and businesses increase their investment. After contracting by 9.8% in the worst recession since 1709 last year, growth will bounce back to 7.25% this year. Sandra Horsfield, UK economist at Investec, described the forecasts as “a hefty upward revision”.

3 . Girl shoots pupils at US school
A girl aged 11 or 12 girl has shot and wounded two of her fellow students and a member of staff at a school in Idaho. Police say the pupil brought a gun to Rigby Middle School and opened fire. A teacher disarmed the girl and detained her until police took her into custody. The three victims are expected to survive, officials said. President Joe Biden recently announce steps to tighten gun controls following a string of mass shootings.

4 . Inquiry calls for NHS spending surge
Spending on the NHS needs to rise by £102bn over the next decade, a commission has concluded. According to a four-year inquiry by the London School of Economics and the Lancet medical journal, the funding injection would cut avoidable deaths from cancer and heart disease, tackle health inequalities and rebuild the NHS after the pandemic. It said the new funds should come largely from tax increases.

5 . Modi’s costly revamp angers India
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come under fire for pushing ahead with a £1.3bn parliamentary revamp, including a new home, during the country’s Covid surge. The costly renovation has been categorised as an “essential service” so construction is allowed to continue even when most building projects have been paused. CNN says the public and opposition politicians are “infuriated” and two citizens have lodged a case with the Delhi High Court to try to halt construction.

6 . Twitter suspends Trump-linked account
Twitter has suspended an account sharing content from Donald Trump’s new communications platform. The account claimed to be tweeting “on behalf” of the former US president but the social media giant said the account broke the rules by helping the former president to circumvent his ban from the social network. Trump launched his own communications platform - titled “From the Desk of Donald J Trump” - on Tuesday.

7 . Travel costs will rise says boss
Holiday costs are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned. Despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service, said Booking.com’s chief executive Glenn Fogel. “There’s so much pent-up demand,” said Fogel. “Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely.”

9 . Lineker in stand-off with taxman
The broadcaster Gary Lineker is being pursued for £4.9m in tax and national insurance in what The Times describes as “the most high-profile battle so far between HMRC and celebrities”. The tax authority says the former England footballer owes £3.62m in income tax and £1.31m in national insurance because he should have been taxed as a direct employee of the BBC and BT Sport. A source close to Lineker described the proceedings as “a shambles”.

‘Le grand surrender’
“Le grand surrender” is the Daily Mail’s headline, as it claims dozens of French trawlers retreated after two Navy gunships arrived. Metro also leads on the row between French fishermen and the UK, with the headline “Smash and crab,” while The Sun goes with “Take Sprat”.

The Times focuses on the Bank of England’s prediction that the UK economy will enjoy its fastest growth in more than seven decades this year.

Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph says Boris Johnson will announce on Monday that secondary school children will no longer have to wear face masks in lessons.

Edition #314. Monday, 28 June 2021

A 🔓 Free newsletter paid newsletter that demystifies the hidden models, incentives and consequences of the most significant events across India and Southeast Asia. Someone sent you this? Subscribe to BFO

Good morning Varkeychan,


a) Betting on sports is illegal in India
b) Running a betting platform for sports is illegal in India



a) Reliance is a green energy champion
b) Reliance is going to be one of the largest gas producers in India



a) WFH improves productivity
b) WFH destroys productivity

Before you answer that, you might want to take a quick peek at The Ken’s first-ever productivity survey results. And oh, there’s an 8 AM read you don’t want to miss!


 

Fancy a punt on the football? Don’t do it
Jaideep Vaidya

Are you watching the Euro 2020 football tournament? Got an office pool on who’s going to win? If you’re watching the football on streaming platform SonyLIV, you might have even seen ads of international betting companies like Betway. But they never use the word “bet” in the ads. It’s always “predict”. 

Why? Because sports betting is illegal in India. 

But then how are these platforms still advertising and operating in India, you ask? Good question. No one seems to know. A couple of stories in the media late last year when the ads first cropped up had various authorities—broadcasters, governing bodies, banks, and governments—passing the buck to each other as to whose responsibility it is to take action. But you would’ve thought at least one party would have cracked the whip by now.

So, after spotting more such ads while watching the Euro 2020 football last week, I decided to register on a couple of these websites to understand how they’re getting around Indian laws.

What I found was pretty amazing. On Betway, I was offered a 100% matched deposit bonus on a minimum deposit of Rs 500 (US$6.7). Basically, if I put in Rs 500, the platform would add another Rs 500 from their side, giving me a balance of Rs 1,000 (US$13.5) to bet with. 

The payment options included online banking, cards, and even UPI, India’s real-time payments system. And there were some other payment gateways I had never even heard of. 

Now, here’s where things got interesting. I clicked on the UPI option. It took me to a page that had details of the UPI ID I had to transfer the money to. The name “Betway” was nowhere to be found. The UPI ID was rhs44@icici. I logged into Google Pay and entered the ID. It was an ICICI Bank account registered under the name of JAI AMBE AGRO TRADERS. A quick Google search reveals several companies in various cities like Jalgaon, Vadodara, and Nashik with similar names.



Betway and Bet365 are both registered in Malta, a tax haven, while Dafabet was founded in the Philippines. Technically, they’re not Indian companies and have no official presence in India. But they’re offering services that are illegal in India to Indian users. Pretty openly. How is that possible?


Q. Just because these companies are not registered in India, are they not culpable under Indian law?

They seem to be a little bold in [assuming] that they won’t be subject to any action under Indian law. It’s like, let’s say, a pornographic website. They may not be operating from India, but they’re offering pornography to users based in India.

 Q. But porn is not illegal in India, right?

Accessing porn is not illegal, but manufacturing, publishing, and circulating it is. Similarly here, while some state laws have punishment for individuals who are actually betting, the bias is towards people who are offering it and who are organising betting or gambling operations. 

Q. So then, how have none of the Indian authorities pounced on this yet? 

Yeah, it’s puzzling. The issue, I think to some extent, is that gaming and gambling is a state matter, so state governments have to take the initiative. Some states have passed laws banning betting, but they’ve not done anything else after that. They don’t proactively block websites in their state.

Q. Fantasy sports is considered a game of skill in India, and is legal. Isn’t there a very thin line between fantasy sports and sports betting? 

Not necessarily, because fantasy sports companies don’t let you try and win based on a binary outcome. The argument is that there is more skill involved because you’re building a team with a set budget and all of that, which is also being held under Indian law. But for betting, there’s nothing like that—you can basically hedge on a binary outcome. And once you do that, it’s not considered a game of skill in India. 

Q. So, basically, these betting companies have put the onus on the users in India…

Correct. I think if they get caught, they’ll just push it on to the users. And if they’re asked to stop operating and shut down, it’s just the user funds that are in danger, right? They will say that you accessed it at your own risk and we don’t have any responsibility for it. 

Q.  That explains the random UPI accounts…

Yes, and they keep changing the accounts, so it’s clearly not completely legitimate. They seem to have got some local operators here, handling all the Indian money. So the money is never leaving India. Basically, somebody’s operating a bank account here on their behalf. Betway’s name never shows up in your transactions. 

Last year, there were some articles that said this could be a FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) violation. But a FEMA violation will come into effect only if the money is going out [of India]. I don’t know how someone can actually prove that the money is going out. 

But using Indian banks’ payment gateways is pretty puzzling because, generally, banks are very thorough and ask for legal opinions. They make sure that it’s a game of skill, and only then allow these guys to hook up their payments to them. Maybe they’re not aware of what it’s being used for. 

Q. What about the advertisements? How are you allowed to advertise betting platforms on streaming websites?

You’re actually not allowed to advertise gambling or betting in India. They’re using a surrogate branding kind of system where they advertise it as a prediction app, and not a betting or gambling app. Dafabet has even established a sports news website called Dafanews. 

Q. So, as a user, should you think twice before using these platforms?

Yeah, especially with tax implications. You’re technically supposed to pay a 33% tax on winnings. And the platforms are doing a KYC check by asking for PAN and Aadhaar details while registering. They’re covering their backs if their records are ever requested by the government. 

As a user, it’s not legal to actually bet in India. While the bias in terms of law enforcement is to go after the organisers rather than people who bet, that doesn’t mean you’re not at risk. Especially when it comes to large amounts. I think the risk is much higher when you’re actually winning and not declaring it.

RIL – stepping on the gas, again
Anand Kalyanaraman

Two announcements at Reliance Industries’ (RIL) recent AGM (annual general meeting) hogged the limelight—the company’s green energy push and the impending launch of the JioPhone Next smartphone. Lost in the din and the razzmatazz was a seemingly innocuous statement by chairman Mukesh Ambani.  

In its exploration and production (E&P) business (the company’s ‘upstream’ oil & gas mining business), bp and Reliance JV commenced production in the KGD6 basin. In record time, it brought two of its three deep water gas projects to production. And it’s on course to add the third. 
This will establish Reliance again as one of the largest producers of gas in India, meeting 20% of India's gas demand. E&P will again be a source of significant value and sustained earnings growth over the next decade.”

Why is this significant? Primarily because E&P has been the rare miss in RILs’ hit parade—refining, petrochemicals, telecom, retail—over the past two decades. The business has been languishing for years for a variety of reasons, ranging  from pricing disputes to production declines. Both its key bets in the domestic market (Krisha Godavari (KG) offshore block) and in the international market (US shale gas) did not live up to expectations. 

Much hope was riding on the KG-D6 block but it flattered to deceive. Gas production here started in April 2009, quickly zoomed to 60 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic metre per day), and was expected to rise much more. But instead, output fell drastically and eventually touched single-digit territory. While RIL blamed geological complexity, the government blamed the company for not drilling enough wells and also accused it of gold-plating costs. A messy legal row ensued. Some also alleged that RIL was suppressing output for want of a good price; the company, of course, dismissed this.

Even global energy major bp that took about 30% stake in the business for top-dollar couldn’t turn things around. Also, the company’s bet on US shale gas came a cropper due to pricing challenges. Ergo, the E&P business turned a dud and stuck out like a sore thumb. Its share in the company’s total revenue shrunk to insignificance and it posted serial losses in contrast to the other profit-churning businesses. In the year ended March 2021, the E&P business posted an operating (EBIT) loss of Rs 1,477 crore (~US$200 million).

But RIL has stepped on the gas again. 

Along with bp, it started production in two wells in the KG-D6 block last year. The output has increased to 12.8 mmscmd, and going by Ambani’s commentary, it should hit 30 mmscmd in a couple of years with a third well. It helps, of course, that gas pricing rules are now more favourable for new fields, especially for deep-sea ones. 

But oil and gas E&P is a notoriously unpredictable business, especially in deep-sea fields—something RIL knows well. Yet, if it manages to pull it off this time around and the path-to-profitability fructifies as planned, RIL’s cash register will ring louder. 

Now, isn’t the company’s renewed focus on natural gas—a fossil fuel—at odds with RIL’s new green energy push? Well, arguably, it is. But then, gas is considered relatively clean, compared with its dirtier cousins such as oil and coal. The Indian government is also batting for its increased use. Trust RIL to have its cake and eat it too.

2,061 readers took The Ken’s survey and most of you told us that your productivity fell, even as work hours and workload rose. The impact of this shows up in many readers’ desire to quit their jobs.

		Hello, and welcome to some of the most fascinating stories I flipped for in the last week. To start, Kathryn A. Whitehead’s TED Talk offers one of the clearest explanations I’ve ever heard of the science behind mRNA treatments and how they forge the path for therapies that could treat Ebola, HIV and even cancer. An excerpt from the book “Four Thousand Weeks” reveals that that’s how long an 80-year-old has on this earth, so, yes, distraction is truly the enemy. How people imagine their pets talking made me smile (cue Rocky the “whoodle” speaking like Werner Herzog). And no $72 fried rice for me. I prefer the indulgence of canned cocktails, not least because their packaging is so pretty.

Plus, how D minor became the saddest musical key and the parameters of Peloton celebrity. |
		
		Interesting stories worth your time. 	
	
 
	
		Presented By 	
	FinanceBuzz 	
	
 
	
		Of all the writing on Afghanistan this week, Air Force veteran Ian Fritz’s essay about listening in on 600 hours of Taliban conversations was among the most insightful. I also loved Slate’s podcast about the family who saw Jesus in a tortilla in ’77. I learned that the key of D minor is so sad even the most somber rockers avoid it. And because I am as invested in gossip as Anne Helen Petersen, I couldn't resist her juicy dissection of Peloton instructor Ally Love's blitz of a wedding.

HOW IT WORKS
Format and scoring

What is the format?

The Ryder Cup has always been decided by match-play, pitting the players against each other rather than the scoreboard. There are 28 matches, each worth one point to the winners.

The first two days see foursomes in the morning, followed by fourballs in the afternoon. Fourball matches involve four players, two from each side, and the player with the lowest score wins the hole for his team. Foursomes is more like doubles, with two players from each team taking it in turns to take a shot. Sunday, the third and final day, will see 12 singles matches take place.


How does the scoring system work?

There are a total 28 points up for grabs. The winner of each match gets one point, with half points for drawn games. Europe, the defending champions, require 14 points to retain the trophy, while the USA will need 14½ points to win it back.

Slides of TOC
  	

Hi Everyone

I didn't uploaded the slides for a few of the lectures. The reason is that you might have noticed that many times I simply put a question on the slide, and then solve it using pen/tablet. I know about many research papers proving that it is a better teaching pedagogy as compared to putting everything on the slides. In addition, my slides of the previous two lectures got corrupted  I don't know why).

Nevertheless, I went through all the previous lectures again and had uploaded the slides wherever possible on Nalanda, including the one for Turing Machine encoding. Please look at these.

Hi

I announced in the previous lecture that Monday's tutorial would be converted into a Lecture. But, because of certain reasons, it cannot be done. Therefore, tomorrow, Monday, you would join in your respective Tutorial Section. 

Moreover, about other issues (syllabus for the compre, etc.), you would be informed on Monday (Nov 23), during the lecture hour.

Moreover, we are trying our best to complete the evaluation of test-3 and test-4 ASAP and should be in a position to declare it within the next 2 to 3 days. Please be patient.

29/30/29-30 (any of these is considered correct for jagged array type definition error), similarly 34/36/34-38 and 42/46/42-46  for the other two types. Remaining errors are at line numbers 51, 55, 56, 57, 58, 61, 64, 66, 68, 70 and 72.


I have observed that a few codes have compatibility issues and many modules are suffering from segmentation faults. If you have obtained marks less than your expectations, please do not panic.  Most zeros are due to the segmentation faults your code displayed on my system in that module. The recheck requests should be uploaded through Nalanda at the new link open from tomorrow onwards for the next three days. 

Please feel free to write to me any issue you face regarding your marks.

TOC Compre Marks
  	

Hi

Your compre marks are uploaded on Nalanda. See Part-A marks on Nalanda. These were auto-evaluated using google quiz, so no rechecks. 






You should apply for rechecks positively by 2 PM, Monday, Dec 21, 2020. After that google form would stop taking responses.

Hi


a) Time of the exam is from 10 AM to 12 Noon.


c) Your camera would be ON during the entire duration of the test. So, arrange for it in case you don't have.

d) Syllabus for the same is the entire syllabus covered in the lectures. The exam is open book.

e) Exact format of the exam would be informed before the exam. You should arrange for A4 size sheets (or equivalent), download necessary app for scanning your work and converting it into pdf file (e.g. camscanner).

f) Make sure that Internet connection is proper, battery backup is there, etc. It is solely your responsibility for doing all the necessary arrangements for giving the exam. No makeup would be entertained for failure to do so.

Dear Students (2019 Batch & Earlier AND 2020 MBA Batch),
Please note that you must keep the Mercer Mettl proctoring tool remain on throughout the exam duration as mentioned by Instructor In-charge.  In case, IC has scheduled the exam in another platform (Google form, Nalanda, Canvas, etc.), you must not click on the submit button on the Mercer Mettl Platform until you complete the examination.  If anyone closes the window and obstructs proctoring, his/her test evaluation will be null & void and IC's decision will be final in this regard.

                    1. I have instructed you to follow a format while naming your file before uploading as it will be very difficult to search your file but there are many students who are not putting the file name in the instructed format so there will be a penalty of 2 marks if you don't follow that particular format.

                                1. I have instructed you to follow a format while naming your file before uploading as it will be very difficult to search your file but there are many students who are not putting the file name in the instructed format so there will be a penalty of 2 marks if you don't follow that particular format.  


                                 


                                    Your file name must be your (BITS ID_Name)  and please write your NAME and ID on the answer sheet also.

                                    1. I have instructed you to follow a format while naming your file before uploading as it will be very difficult to search your file but there are many students who are not putting the file name in the instructed format so there will be a penalty of 2 marks if you don't follow that particular format.  


                                     


                                        Your file name must be your (BITS ID_Name)  and please write your NAME and ID on the answer sheet also.

                                1. I have instructed you to follow a format while naming your file before uploading as it will be very difficult to search your file but there are many students who are not putting the file name in the instructed format so there will be a penalty of 2 marks if you don't follow that particular format.  


                                 


                                    Your file name must be your (BITS ID_Name)  and please write your NAME and ID on the answer sheet also.

Dear All,


Currently all the notices are sent through e-mail. The present system supports mainly three groups namely student, Faculty and staff. The mails can be sent to individual groups or to multiple groups. The present facility does not offer mail delivery to the fine grained targeted email groups causing the individual mailbox cluttering.  

The team of IPC and SDET has taken up a new initiative and they have created a portal which  aims to provide a single dashboard for the posting and access to the various notices/announcements.

To begin with , we intend to provide notice posting rights to Head of departments, division heads, faculty-in-charges  and unit heads. Once the facility is operationalized, the root email facility will be withdrawn. The individual faculty members will continue to use the Nalanda email/announcement  facility to send the course related communication to the students. 
Hoping for your kind cooperation.

With the best regards,

Sudhirkumar Barai
Director, BITS Pilani-Pilani Campus

From the desk of FIITJEE Chennai Centre Director


Hope this mail finds you in absolute spirits and good health. It has been a complete pleasure to connect with you yet again. I am extremely delighted to share my happiness over the recently declared JEE Advanced results 2021. FIITJEE has proved its legacy in winning par excellence. Our Student Anand Narasimhan from Chennai Centre has brought laurels and accolades by securing the All in Rank 17.

FIITJEE Chennai center has been triumphant in producing Tamil Nadu State Topper for the 14th year consecutively. FIITJEE Chennai center has bagged extraordinary results by securing a total of 15 ranks in Top 500, 28 in Top 1000 ranks and 51 in Top 2000 ranks with overall of 306 selections in JEE Advanced exams. At the National arena, FIITJEE has created a niche by securing a total of 6 in Top 10 ranks, 12 in Top 20 ranks, 18 in Top 30 and 36 in Top 100. FIITJEE student’s stands tall with splendid top ranks and emerge victorious in JEE Advanced 2021 exams, with overall selections of more than 4239 students at PAN India level.

On an average around 14-15 lakhs students appear for JEE Mains every year for the 16232 seats in IITs and only around 2 lakhs students get selected to appear in JEE Advanced. The students work meticulously to secure a rank in top 2000 to get their preferred branch/stream. It is quite obvious that securing a rank beyond 3000 would make it difficult for a student to select a stream of their choice. The above figures of the appearing students speak volumes of the fierce competition prevailing to get admitted in the IITs.

FIITJEE as an institute plays an important role in broadening the mental horizon of young learners and develop right attitude towards learning. It is quite important for us to understand that training students to ace in such competitive exams requires constant updation and to adopt strategies for effective teaching and learning.

“The capacity to learn is a gift; The ability to learn is a skill; but the willingness to learn is a choice”.

In our endeavors to promote serious learning FIITJEE urges every student to learn to utilize every moment of their life purposefully and productively. We believe that learning is a true treasure which will follow its owner everywhere; so cherish this treasure and be lifelong learners. Success is no accident, it is a culmination of hard work, perseverance and most of all love for what you are doing or learning to do. Let us strive to stay positive and derive happiness from whatever we are learning/doing.

FIITJEE makes a strong emphasis that school education is an integral part of student education. We lay focus on quality education and make sincere efforts to ensure that education is not limited to Curriculum alone. Our competitors in KOTA and Andhra Pradesh follow different strategies and part or compromise with the school education. FIITJEE on the other hand has been successful in delivering excellent to extraordinary results without compromising on the school curriculum amidst all potential competitors.

FIITJEE has been striving hard in our constant efforts to uphold our levels of commitment to students in providing an enriching and ethical learning environment. In 2019 one of the topmost coaching Institutes from Hyderabad lured our faculty and poached upon our top students and faculty by promising them with best coaching and took away our students to their institute. FIITJEE with its strong ethical values and principles overcome this challenge with utmost belief that Perseverance, hard work and abiding faiths are indispensable for attainment of excellence. Students who continued with FIITJEE performed better and secured better ranks. FIITJEE has always proved its excellence through one and only thing, its 'RESULTS'.

The toil of years, the sweat of your brow, the struggle you make, everything counts in achieving the goal.

Needless to mention, for securing a top rank in IIT there is no need to part with the school education nor be hooked with any strategy. FIIJEE strongly believes that its best training and teaching methodologies equip the students with all round capabilities in achieving benchmarking success in their academic pursuit.


Regards,

Ankur Kumar Jain

Hello Dear, 

I know this email might come to you as a surprise as first coming from one you have not met with before. I am Mr. Barry Mapule, the bank manager with ABSA bank of South Africa, and a personal banker of Mr. Kamal Husain, an Egyptian who happened to be a contractor attached to the overthrown Afghan government by the Taliban government.
 Mr. Kamal Husain deposits some sum of money with our bank but passed away with his family on 16 May 2017 trying to escape from Kandahar.
The said sum can be used for an investment if you are interested. Details relating to the funds are in my position and will present you as the Next-of-Kin because there was none, and I shall furnish you with more detail once your response.
Kind Regards, 
Mr. Barry Mapule.
South Africa.

Take Best Business Pictures With Just Your Phone

iPrice

Before the rise of smartphones, taking a picture may be a difficult task especially to those with businesses. You'd have to get an expensive camera and editing software for your desktop computer, as well as devote a significant amount of time and effort to learn how to use them. Thanks to our smartphones, we now can capture high-quality images and edit them effortlessly. There are a few additional tools and accessories that substantially enhance your images. Here's how to take and produce stunning pictures like a professional with only your phone for your business. 

Get a good lighting for your shot
First and foremost, good lighting plays the biggest role in producing the best pictures. Due to their small sensors, only a few smartphones can generate outstanding indoor images. Hence, for the best effects, shoot images outside in the ideal lighting circumstances. Lighting affects not only the luminance of a photograph, but also the mood, tone, and atmosphere. 

When shooting outside, choose a time of day when the light is mellow, such as early morning or evening. This creates a soft, even light with pleasing tones. If you must photograph in direct sunlight, attempt to do so in the shade or angling your subject with the sun in your shot.
